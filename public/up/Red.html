<p>Xiaoman’s Handicraft Class (3)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman sniffed and stopped crying. She finally realized why she lost.<br>
Last night, Grandma also offered to help, but Jiang Xiaoman refused. It turned out that you need the help of adults! She remembered it now!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was looking forward to getting the first place on the next handicraft class.<br>
It was just that the handicraft class had changed again. This time they weren’t making flower baskets, but clay figurines.<br>
After returning home, Jiang Xiaoman asked eagerly, “Grandma, can you make clay figurines?”<br>
“Does your kindergarten still teach people to play with mud?”<br>
“It’s not playing with mud. It’s making clay figurines. You know…making figurines from clay!”<br>
Jiang Xiumei didn’t like children playing with mud because it made clothes too difficult to wash. Jiang Xiaoman was usually told not to go to dirty and smelly places, so her mud playing skills were not good.<br>
“No, maybe your uncle could,” Jiang Xiumei said, “He grew up playing in the mud.”<br>
“Oh—”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman thought about it.<br>
She got annoyed because Uncle had gone back to the village and was not at home.<br>
How could he help her with handicraft lessons?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman took twenty cents and went to the small shop to make a call.<br>
The house in the city did not have a landline phone, and it was very troublesome to contact Jiang Xing.<br>
“Uncle.” Jiang Xiaoman held the phone and asked him, “When will you come back to help me with the handicraft homework?”<br>
“What?” Jiang Xing was in the mine, and it was very noisy, so Jiang Xiaoman’s voice was a bit unclear.<br>
“I said, when will you come back and help me make clay figurines!!”<br>
“I don’t know how to make clay figurines!”<br>
“But Grandma said you grew up playing with mud.” Jiang Xiaoman’s mouth pursed, and her heart felt empty.<br>
Uncle was so busy that he couldn’t accompany her. She was so sad.<br>
“Other children have their parents to help with their handicraft homework, but I don’t have one,” Jiang Xiaoman sobbed, “Haah, forget it. Uncle, you go on with your business. I can do it alone.”<br>
Listening to her sobs hurt Jiang Xing’s conscience.<br>
He also didn’t want to be away from home every day, nor did he want to go back to the village at this time.<br>
But that Hong Xingguo father and son pair came to make some trouble, and the team here asked him to come back to deal with it. He had no choice but to come back.<br>
“Xiaoman, when do you have to hand in your handicraft?”<br>
“Tomorrow.”<br>
“Oh, then I will go back tomorrow.”<br>
Uncle was so stupid. How would they have enough time if he only came back tomorrow? Could she still make something from mud before coming to school?<br>
Before she could refuse, Jiang Xing said, “I will bring you a ready-made one. I guarantee that you’ll get the first place with it.”<br>
First place?<br>
That’s great. That’s great!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was happy again. She clapped her hands and said that she would be waiting for Uncle to come back.<br>
The twenty cents worth of phone time was up, and Jiang Xiaoman hung up.<br>
She couldn’t make one herself, but she could wait for her uncle to make one. She began looking forward to what kind of surprise her uncle would bring her tomorrow.<br>
The next day, Jiang Xing woke up early and rushed back from the village to bring the child to school.<br>
He brought a figurine back and covered it with a red cloth. It was almost as big as Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman tried to lift it up, but it wouldn’t budge.<br>
“What is this?”<br>
“Secret.” Jiang Xing said with a smile. “This time, you will get first place. I promise there is nothing as beautiful as this in the city. This is our family’s treasure. I brought it for you.”<br>
Since it was a treasure, it had to be good. Jiang Xiaoman nodded and let Jiang Xing take the figure into the classroom and lift the red cloth.<br>
Ha!<br>
Holy shit!<br>
Covered under the red cloth was a majestic, vicious stone lion!<br>
“Waa!!”<br>
“Waow!!”<br>
“Waooow!!”<br>
“!!!”<br>
The children were shocked, Yu Qingshi was shocked, Teacher Yang was shocked, and Jiang Xiaoman was also shocked.</p>

<p>Is Ultraman OK? (1)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman’s mouth dropped, and for a while, she also didn’t know how to react.<br>
The children were exclaiming in amazement.<br>
They had never seen such a fierce stone lion before. It was so majestic!<br>
Zhang Xinhua stared at it blankly for a while, then asked Xiaoman, “Xiaoman, is this your handicraft?”<br>
“Ye…yeah.” Jiang Xiaoman twiddled with her fingers while whispering. “It’s just that my uncle helped make it.”<br>
The more she stared, the more familiar the stone lion seemed. Xiaoman quickly realized: wasn’t this the stone lion that guarded the doors of their house in the village? If Grandma found out, wouldn’t Xiaoman get spanked when she got home?<br>
Zhang Xinhua muttered a “Wow” again with a very exaggerated expression.<br>
Ye Jiajia pointed to the mud at the base of the lion statue and asked, “Xiaoman, is this made of stone or earth? Why is there mud on it?”<br>
“It is made from stone. The stone lion used to protect the door of my house in the village. Grandma said that having it at the door would keep the house safe and invite fortune.”<br>
Oops, she accidentally blurted it out.<br>
Xiaoman quickly covered her mouth. Fortunately, the children paid no attention.<br>
“What does keeping the house safe mean?”<br>
“What does inviting fortune mean?”<br>
“…” Jiang Xiaoman suddenly discovered that she was not the only chatterbox. Every child under the sky was all the same.<br>
She didn’t answer those questions because she didn’t understand them very well. She just continued saying, “Anyways, Grandma said that it’s good open to put a sacred beast at the door of your house.”<br>
“What kind of beast is a sacred beast? ”<br>
“Up to you. I don’t know either. As long as it looks a bit weird, it should be okay.”<br>
Zhang Xinhua seemed to be thinking of something. He nodded his head and said, “Then I’m also going to ask my dad to put one to guard the front of our house.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked curiously, “What are you going to put?”<br>
“Is Ultraman OK?”<br>
Ultraman?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman held her head and thought for a while, then said, “Then, I also want to put up the Monkey King.”<br>
The two children reached a consensus and planned to raise the topic as soon as they got home.<br>
The children in junior class 3 liked the majestic stone lion, and asked Xiaoman if they could touch it.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very happy and generously said they could touch it, but they had to form a queue.<br>
Everyone could only touch it once before letting the next kid get their turn.<br>
Some of the children asked to ride the stone lion, but Xiaoman did not let them.<br>
After all, it was not a wooden horse. How could it be ridden?<br>
Well, they weren’t wrong. The stone lion was indeed of a very suitable size for children to ride on. Xiaoman had once tried riding on it too when it was in front of their house.<br>
As a consequence, Grandma spanked her, saying that she was acting inappropriate and disrespectful, and the lion would not protect her.<br>
After the children formed a long queue, everyone was able to touch the rock lion, then went to class content.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was in a very good mood when school was over.<br>
Jiang Xing didn’t go back to the village right away. He planned to stay here for one night first, so he came to pick up Xiaoman today while also taking away the stone lion.<br>
He brought it to their house in the city to guard it.<br>
The stone lion was indeed taken from their house in the village.<br>
The soil at its base had not been wiped clean, and the marks left by the wind and frozen dew over the years had given it an old, quaint look.<br>
Jiang Xiumei said that she had especially sought out an old stonemason to make it. It was his ancestral craft, and now that the old stonemason had passed away, no one had inherited the craftsmanship, and it was almost extinct.<br>
This stone lion was a unique treasure indeed.<br>
Jiang Xing didn’t know how to make clay figurines, but he also didn’t want his niece to be embarrassed, so he could only pry out the stone lion and bring it with him.<br>
They wouldn’t be staying in their house in the village as much, so the lion was not guarding the right place anyways. Might as well bring it over.</p>

<p>Is Ultraman OK? (2)<br>
Xiaoman expressed her concern, “Uncle, will Grandma beat us? She treasures this stone lion very much.”<br>
She wouldn’t even allow her to ride it.<br>
Jiang Xing had no sense of crisis at all, unaware of the beatings he was going to face. He said, “Don’t worry. Even if she’s going to hit someone, she’s just going to hit me. She won’t hit you.”<br>
“Oh.” Jiang Xiaoman wanted to say, “Uncle, you take the vanguard, ok?” but she felt that uncle was very miserable after thinking about it. After coming home from being away for so long, he was going to be beaten. If he ran away after being beaten by Grandma, how could Xiiaoman find him?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said with a worried face, taking Jiang Xing’s hand, “Uncle, later if Grandma hits you, hide behind me. I’ll block her for you!”<br>
Jiang Xing gave an ambiguous smile, “Don’t worry. I haven’t been home for so long. Even if she’s angry, she won’t hit me. Right now, she loves me very much. She’ll start despising me again tomorrow, but by then, I’ll be gone and she can’t hit me.”<br>
“Oh, that’s good then.” Adults always have so many weird excuses. Jiang Xiaoman couldn’t understand them.<br>
Unfortunately, Jiang Xing really overestimated his status.<br>
He hadn’t come home for so long. At first, Jiang Xiumei was very happy. She called his name and talked about him all the time. Of course, she would be happy when her son came home.<br>
But, holy shit! He actually brought the stone lion from back in the village<br>
Jiang Xiumei was superstitious and cared about Feng Shui very much.<br>
The old stonemason was well known in the area, and he had very good craftsmanship. It was said with one of his lions, even if the descendants were hit with bloody misfortune for three generations, their ancestors would still protect them. Back then, Jiang Xiumei put a lot of effort into getting one of those statues, but in the end, her turtle of a son actually pried it out!<br>
Even if they had moved to the city, the house in the village was their ancestral house! How could it be tampered with?<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s fist hardened.<br>
She almost wanted to punch someone.<br>
But Jiang Xing pretended to be pitiful and begged for mercy. Jiang Xiumei’s temper finally died down. She had to remind herself a few times that he was her own son. Only then could she finally suppress her anger.<br>
He thought that the incident would end like that.<br>
Who would’ve thought that the more Jiang Xiumei thought about it, the angrier she became? The love and affection she had for her son did not last past a single mealtime. During dinner, she angrily slammed the chopsticks and beat him up.<br>
A mother’s love is so fleeting.<br>
Jiang Xing didn’t dare to stay anymore and wanted to run away that very night.<br>
“Mom, don’t beat me up anymore. I still have serious business to do! If you cripple me, what should I do if I can’t beat that Hong Xingguo father and son pair later?”<br>
When he mentioned Hong Xingguo and his son, Jiang Xiumei stopped beating him.<br>
She furrowed her eyebrows and asked, “What the hell is going on? Are they making trouble again?”<br>
“Yeah.” Jiang Xing said, “They are shameless. They’re finally being released after being detained last time. Those lazy bums only know how to sleep and e. Allll they’re doing is trying to take advantage of people.”<br>
“Get to the point!!!”<br>
“They still want to blackmail our family, but fortunately, I am smart and intelligent. I already told the neighbors that we have severed all relationships with them. They couldn’t find us, so they angrily went to the mine to look for me to cause trouble. They didn’t expect me to not be there. They were considered as troublemakers instead and got beaten up.”<br>
The people from the logistics team came to inform Jiang Xing, and he ran back to deal with it.<br>
Of course, it wasn’t to defend the two relatives he had already broken off with. Instead, it was to confirm that they really had nothing to do with each other anymore, so his brothers from the logistics team could start beating them up again, even harder and more viciously.<br>
Hong Xingguo and his son were very angry and made a scene again at the mine, hitting a miner worker until he was injured and causing a dispute. That’s why it took days to sort things out. What a waste of time.</p>

<p>Is Ultraman OK? (3)<br>
After hearing the whole story, Jiang Xiumei said, “They’re lucky they didn’t meet me, or I would beat them up too!”<br>
Only then did Jiang Xing finally escaped the beating.<br>
Reading really made people wise. This trick was also something he learned after immersing himself in books lately.<br>
In ancient times this was called ‘shifting the waters of disaster to the east.’ In modern times, this was called shifting the blame.<br>
It was very useful.<br>
–<br>
Not long after the Jiang family house finally calmed down, when the sky started getting dark, someone else appeared again.<br>
It was Hong Xingguo, coming alone.<br>
He secretly followed Jiang Xing here.<br>
Before this, he came to the Jiang family house to take advantage of them. But unexpectedly, after he was released from detainment, the Jiang family had already moved to the city!<br>
Wow! They had a good life, and they didn’t even include him! What kind of relative was this? Was this how a person should be?<br>
Hong Xingguo started to make trouble.<br>
But when they cut off their relationship before, Jiang Xiumei spread the word that his family had already received money from the Jiangs. If they came again in the future, that would be utterly shameless.<br>
Both the men and the women in the village were all chatterboxes, and the story had spread far and wide long ago. Not only did he fail in causing trouble, he even got a visit from the village chief.<br>
The village chief felt that he was being a nuisance and brought a few strong men to throw their family out until they didn’t dare to cause trouble anymore.<br>
But Hong Xingguo had not given up yet.<br>
The monk can run, but the temple can’t run with him.<br>
He didn’t know where the Jiang family had moved to in the city, but he knew where the logistics team was, so he went there to cause trouble.<br>
After a few days of causing trouble, there were finally some results.<br>
He got beaten up.<br>
Being beaten up was also go. He could blackmail or bluff someone.<br>
Jiang Xing was finally forced to go back.<br>
Hong Xingguo couldn’t get any advantage in their dispute. Other than causing trouble at the logistics team and the mine, Hong Xingguo also secretly kept tabs on Jiang Xing’s actions.<br>
Seeing him going home to the city early in the morning, Hong Xingguo followed him.<br>
He finally found out where the Jiang family was!<br>
Unfortunately, his face was full of disbelief when he stood in front of their door.<br>
This, was this really the Jiang family’s house in the city?<br>
Why was it so old and shabby? It was even worse than a house in the village! Was there something wrong with their head?<br>
Hong Xingguo felt dizzy.<br>
Was the Jiang family’s life actually not as good as the stories circulating outside? Was it all just boasting? Did he get beaten up for nothing?<br>
Otherwise, how would you explain this house? It was too shabby! It couldn’t even compare to his! It was so bad he wouldn’t even want it if they gave it to him!<br>
Hong Xingguo felt bamboozled.<br>
He yelled outside the Jiang family house. “This rotten family! You no-good thing! Keep bragging without reflecting on your own situation! Still pretending to be a boss? The way I see it, you’re going to go bankrupt and run away by tomorrow!”<br>
He cursed Jiang Xing indiscriminately but still couldn’t vent all his anger. Hong Xingguo kicked the door with his foot and shouted, “You kid caused this old one to get beaten up. This debt isn’t settled yet!”<br>
He was yelling so much at the door that the people inside could hear him.<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s face turned as dark as a pot’s belly, and she went straight to the kitchen to grab a knife.<br>
“Mom, please calm down!” Jiang Xing still wanted to hold her back.<br>
At this time, Hong Xingguo started looking for death again.<br>
He continued to curse, “Still bringing home a wild seed from who knows where. You treat a wild child better than your own family! Something’s wrong with your head!”<br>
Jiang Xing was very angry and rushed out. He slammed the door and pinned Hong Xingguo with the door panel. Thinking that he could not let the ears of Xiaoman inside get polluted by his foul words, he covered up his mouth with all his strength and shouted loudly, “Mom! Mom, hurry up! I already covered his mouth. Beat him up!”</p>

<p>It’s All Over! (1)<br>
When Jiang Xiumei came out angrily carrying a kitchen knife, Hong Xingguo was like a fish on a cutting board. Jiang Xing pressed Hong Xingguo down, allowing Jiang Xiumei to do whatever she wanted.<br>
Hong Xingguo struggled, but Jiang Xing pressed him down with both hands.<br>
Light glinted off the kitchen knife, which smelled like celery, in Jiang Xiumei’s hand.<br>
“Let me go—” Jiang Xing covered Hong Xingguo’s mouth before he could finish his sentence, not allowing any sound to come out.<br>
Jiang Xiumei looked at him coldly for a long time, then waved the kitchen knife in her hand and coldly said, “I already told you our relationship is over. I don’t want anything to do with you anymore. You’ve already seen what our life in the city is like. You don’t need to come here looking to take advantage of us anymore.”<br>
After saying that, Hong Xingguo shamefully slumped down like a deflated balloon.<br>
What was the point if he could not get any benefit from them? There was no hope.<br>
Jiang Xiumei continued, “You wouldn’t help when you saw my daughter dying. I’m generous by not finishing you off with this knife right now. Since you have no shame, I won’t be polite with you anymore!”<br>
“Mmm!!” Hong Xingguo desperately struggled to speak.<br>
Jiang Xing hesitated for a while, then turned around and asked his mother. “Mom, it seems that he has something to say.”<br>
“Let him speak.”<br>
Hong Xingguo could finally get a breath of fresh air again.<br>
He glared at Jiang Xiumei and sneered, “I didn’t believe it when our parents said you were an ungrateful child. I never expected you to be so cruel! Let’s not even talk about how you changed your surname as soon as you got married.1 Our parents have only been dead for a few years, and you no longer acknowledge me. You have a logistics company now. Isn’t giving us a few thousand yuans fine? Every family in the village helps each other. But you bastards don’t even acknowledge your poor relatives after growing up! We are still brother and sister!”<br>
“You—” Jiang Xiumei’s eyes bulged, but before she had time to speak, Hong Xingguo already said, “Of course, the Heavens have eyes! Your life is not getting better now, right? I think, sooner or later, you will be finished! And you’re still taking care of that wild child you picked up outside! If it weren’t for her, Jiang Yue might not have gotten sick!”<br>
“Hold him down for me!” Jiang Xiumei was furious.<br>
But Hong Xingguo was prepared this time and was not so easily held down. He slid away like an eel. Jiang Xing could not hold him down.<br>
“Xiaoman is not a wild child. Watch your mouth!”<br>
“Is she not a wild child? Who even knows where she even came from? If you weren’t hiding something, why aren’t you forthright? Would we have been secretly laughed at by the neighbors if it weren’t for her? Even if she wasn’t a kid you picked up on the streets, she would be your daughter’s illegitimate daughter.”<br>
The mention of Jiang Yue deeply pained Jiang Xiumei. Hong Xingguo went too far with his words, and Jiang Xiumei’s eyes had turned red; she no longer cared about anything. She charged at him and pummeled Hong Xingguo.<br>
Pa! She hit him using all of her strength.<br>
“You—” Hong Xingguo was furious and opened his mouth to speak, but when he saw her scarlet-red eyes, he became so scared he did not dare say anything.<br>
This old lady was so powerful! Hong Xingguo felt as if his teeth was going to fall out.<br>
“Ptui!” His mouth filled with the taste of iron, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.<br>
Hong Xingguo cursed, “You damned wench! How dare you refuse to admit to your sins?!”<br>
“I dare!” Jiang Xiumei went berserk and gripped his collar. “What do I not dare to do? Xiaoman was picked up? Xiaoman is not our family’s child? So what?! Not only do I treat her better than you, but I also treat my pigs better than you! Pigs can still be eaten after I raise them. Will you wag your tail when I’m good to you?”<br>

<p>It’s All Over! (2)<br>
“When have I, Jiang Xiumei, ever been afraid of what other people say? When their father died, my two children and I almost couldn’t survive. What did you say to me when I brought them to your door and begged you for some food? You said that people should live honorably and stand tall with their own two feet. People should rely on themselves rather than the Heavens or the Earth!”<br>
“I took my children with me and ate Guanyin clay2 and tree roots. We got through it, and our lives have finally improved! So why don’t you strive to live honorably, too? Practice what you preach! Hong Xingguo, listen to my words! You will never be able to pay off your debt to me in your lifetime! I never brought it up, but you still dared to come here. You’re just asking to get beat!”<br>
Even after scolding him, Jiang Xiumei still felt furious, and she slapped him twice.<br>
For years, which had felt more like a lifetime, Jiang Xiumei had suppressed her anger.<br>
Hong Xingguo looked at her in a daze. His head was spinning after being beaten.<br>
He opened his mouth to speak, but before he could talk, Jiang Xiumei talked over him. There was no room for his voice.<br>
Jiang Xiumei listed his faults one by one.<br>
Jiang Xing only listened. He did not say a word and only silently watched as his uncle was beaten.<br>
He was not cold-blooded, but he still remembered the events Jiang Xiumei was mentioning, although they had occurred many years earlier.<br>
Those days had been harsh.<br>
He didn’t realize his mother had such a hard life. Her fierce character was also something that had formed during those days.<br>
She was a widow raising two children. If she wasn’t fierce, how could she have made it? He had misjudged her. From now on, he wouldn’t feel that the beatings she had given him were as painful anymore. He really did deserve to be beaten.<br>
Hong Xingguo came to take advantage of them but only got scoldings instead. No one had ever scolded him ever since his parents died. Of course, they spoiled him so much, and maybe they had never even scolded him in the first place. But after his parents passed away, his life gradually became more difficult because no one helped him work.<br>
Now, Jiang Xiumei was going berserk, and Jiang Xing next to her was still eyeing him like a tiger. Hong Xingguo’s mind was chaotic.<br>
He had planned on causing an uproar to make people come and watch the spectacle and make Jiang Xiumei lose face like last time so she would give him some money to go away. If they were back in the village, the people with nothing to do would have already come to watch the show. But here in the city, no one came even after he made such a fuss.<br>
No one was interested at all.<br>
Hong Xingguo had miscalculated. No matter how much fuss he caused, he wouldn’t get the result he wanted without an audience.<br>
“I won’t lower myself to your level.” Hong Xingguo was very upset. He received a beating and got absolutely nothing out of it. He desperately tried to get away from her. “Let me go. I’m going home.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei still wanted to give him a beating, but when he said he was going home, she decided she’d rather not see this trash anymore. She immediately dragged him by the collar and threw him out of the house, then slammed the door shut.<br>
Peace finally returned to the world.<br>
Perhaps Hong Xingguo saw that this place was too shabby and there was no advantage he could get, or maybe he was scolded so harshly he didn’t have the courage left to see anyone. He quickly walked away and left.<br>
“Mom…” Jiang Xing said. “I think I’m unworthy.”<br>
“You’re still not that bad.” Jiang Xiumei sighed and said, “I’m not asking too much from you. I’ll be happy as long as you could live a good, honest life. Right now, we’re already doing much better. It would have been even better if your sister were still here.”<br>

<p>It’s All Over! (3)<br>
She felt that her son had turned over a new leaf. Even if one day she suddenly closed her eyes and left, he could take care of himself.<br>
People live in this world only so they can leave it in peace.<br>
Jiang Xing sighed and said nothing.<br>
When Jiang Xiumei returned inside, she suddenly bumped into Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was sitting on a chair obediently. The chair was a bit tall, so her short legs couldn’t reach the ground. Her feet were dangling, and she was putting her hands on her knees; this was the sitting posture that she learned in kindergarten, a very proper and well-behaved one.<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s heart tightened upon seeing Xiaoman’s innocent and clear eyes.<br>
Just now, she scolded Hong Xingguo while throwing all caution to the wind. She didn’t remember about this child inside; did she hear everything she said?<br>
Jiang Xiumei walked over and asked, “My dear baby, why haven’t you slept yet?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman shook her head, but she didn’t cry or make a fuss.<br>
Usually, she would have cried by now.<br>
At the very least, she would be asking what it meant that she was not a child of the Jiang family or what a wild child was.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman didn’t ask anything tonight. Her behavior was alarming.<br>
Jiang Xiumei hesitated for a while and asked her, “Xiaoman, did you hear everything just now?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman nodded and said softly, “I heard you.”<br>
Xiaoman still had memories from New Years’. She felt that Hong Xingguo was a bad person, so she obediently stayed inside so she would not trouble Grandma and Uncle.<br>
“You… have nothing to ask?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman shook her head, but then she asked, “Grandma, is he going to come again? ”<br>
“This… probably not.” Jiang Xiumei touched her head. After thinking for a bit, she said, “Xiaoman, if he says something horrible like you not being a child of our family, don’t believe it. He’s a bad guy who specializes in deceiving children.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was surprised, “Well, I’m not, right?”<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s face turned pale, and she was so shocked that she didn’t know what to say. She trembled and asked, “Who told you?”<br>
“The teacher told me.”<br>
“Eh?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman scratched her head and said, “Teacher taught me that Father’s father is called Yeye, and Mother’s mother is called Waipo3. I’m originally Mother’s daughter, not Grandma’s daughter. So why do I call you Grandma instead of Waipo?” with a distressed expression.<br>
“Ah…ah. This…So the kindergarten still teaches this.” Jiang Xiumei felt complicated.<br>
Jiang Xiumei calmly said, “I am Xiaoman’s Waipo, but in spoken language I’m called Grandma. If you want to call me Waipo, then you can call me Waipo. Anyways, Grandma is Waipo, and Waipo is Grandma.”<br>
“Then why have I been calling you Grandma since I was little? Why have I not been calling you Waipo?”<br>
“Because…because Grandma is easier to say. I also called my Waipo, Grandma.” Jiang Xiumei smiled and rubbed her head. “This kindergarten is very good. Xiaoman really became smarter than before. Grandma is happy.”<br>
“Oh, I understand now.” Jiang Xiaoman finally understood, and she happily said, “If Grandma is happy, I’m happy too.”<br>
That song was really hard and complicated3.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had no father or grandfather. There were many relationships that she did not understand.<br>
But what had troubled her for days were finally solved.<br>
So it turned out that Grandma was Waipo. Because she couldn’t make sense of that relationship, she almost thought that she was a child that was picked up.<br>
After great effort, she finally managed to coax the child to sleep. When Jiang Xiumei carried Xiaoman to the bed, her eyes caught the crescent-shaped jade pendant on her neck. She froze for a moment, then she took it off and took it away.<br>
System: “!!!”<br>
What was happening?? You, put it down! Put the jade pendant down!<br>
Host! Host, quickly wake up! Our important mission item is being taken away by your grandma! Quickly wake up!! Help!! Who’s going to stop her!!!<br>
Its life was over!!!<br>

3. There’s a specific way to address each family member in Chinese. Grandparents from the mother’s and father’s side have different way of address. Older/Younger aunts and uncles from mother’s and father’s side are also called differently. It’s so complicated that they use a children song to teach them this complicated relationship, which is how Xiaoman learnt it in kindergarten.<br>
You can check an example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMpJrOQTjbE<br>
Now based on that way of address, Jiang Xiumei should be called Waipo, but Xiaoman has been calling her Laolao, which have been translated as Grandma. All the Grandma (Laolao) references in italics are when it’s usage is being directly contrasted against Waipo. As Jiang Xiumei said, they all mean grandmother.</p>

<p>Host, You’re Too Much!! (1)<br>
Where had Xiaoman actually come from? Jiang Xiumei didn’t know.<br>
Jiang Yue got a good job after graduating from university and moved to the city. Jiang Xiumei did not want to burden her daughter, and she had also been accustomed to life in the village, so she didn’t follow her to the city. She did not know anything about what happened to Jiang Yue back then.<br>
She only knew that her daughter, who had only been away from home for a few months, left with a flat stomach, and when she came back, she brought a little girl with her.<br>
Jiang Yue said that the child was hers.<br>
Bullshit!<br>
Others might not know, but how could she fool her own mother?<br>
But Jiang Yue wouldn’t say where the child came from and insisted that she gave birth to her.<br>
It seemed that her daughter had a secret she was unwilling to tell.<br>
Jiang Yue had never made Jiang Xiumei worry. This was the only time; even if she was beaten, Jiang Yue would not say anything.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had no choice but to acknowledge this granddaughter that came out of nowhere.<br>
Jiang Yue said that she would raise Xiaoman well and not go back to the city anymore. She wanted to be a good teacher in the village, just like Teacher Tang.<br>
So many people tried their best to come down from the mountain, but Jiang Yue was the other way around. She already managed to leave after great effort but ended up returning again.<br>
At that time, Teacher Tang came to the house to talk to her. Jiang Xiumei did not know what they were talking about; all she knew was that Teacher Tang left with a complicated expression, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had also accepted her fate.<br>
Her daughter was a Golden Phoenix, but unfortunately, fate did not let her soar to the sky. Well, it was fine if Jiang Yue returned home. The three of them could rely on each other. As long as the whole family was united, there were no challenges that could not be overcome.<br>
Who would’ve thought that her fate was so terrible? The misfortune did not stop there.<br>
It would be great if illness did not exist, but unfortunately, the Heavens play tricks on mortals.<br>
After Jiang Yue departed, Jiang Xiumei once thought about giving Jiang Xiaoman away.<br>
But she had also raised her for a long time by then—enough time to get attached even if one were just raising a dog. Jiang Xing also liked Xiaoman. Jiang Xing, who was usually never home, often came back to see his niece after Xiaoman appeared.<br>
His hands were never empty whenever he came back. He would bring candies and small toys, all to coax her.<br>
Regardless of the adult’s affairs, Xiaoman was a good girl.<br>
Even though she was just a baby back then, she was white and soft, did not cry or make a fuss, and was very obedient. If you teased her, she would babble and laugh at you.<br>
Jiang Xiumei couldn’t bear to drive her away, and Jiang Yue also cared about Xiaoman so much so she didn’t end up giving her away.<br>
Their house was very lonely anyways. There were only her and Jiang Xing left. Raising Xiaoman was merely adding another pair of chopsticks. This was how she ended up continuing to be raised by them.<br>
She called Jiang Xiumei, Grandma, and Jiang Xing, Uncle.<br>
She was usually good and well-behaved and got spanked when she was occasionally naughty. Overall, she was still very cute. Xiaoman was Jiang Xiumei’s intimate little padded jacket.<br>
Jiang Xiumei raised her not only like a granddaughter but also like her own daughter too. She poured all her love for Jiang Yue into Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Tonight, Hong Xingguo called her a wild seed, a wild child who came from who knows where. Aside from being furious, she was also scared.<br>
Xiaoman was someone else’s child. What if… what if her parents came here? What should she do if they wanted to take her away?<br>
She had worked so hard to raise such a good child. How could somebody else just come and take her away? No way!</p>

<p>Host, You’re Too Much!! (2)<br>
The jade pendant was already on Xiaoman ever since she was little. Jiang Yue said that she had worn it ever since she was born, and it must never be thrown away. That was why no matter how hard their life had gotten, Jiang Xiumei never once thought about selling it.<br>
But tonight… For some reason, she decided to put it away.<br>
–<br>
Jiang Xiaoman slept well and even had a very magical dream.<br>
She was still singing that song in her dream.<br>
“What is Father’s father called? Father’s father is called Grandpa (Yeye).”<br>
……<br>
What is Mother’s mother called? Mother’s mother is called Grandma (Laolao).<br>
Is called Grandma (Laolao)1!!!<br>
She finally made sense of this complicated family relationship! She could finally sing it now!!!<br>
The following day was the weekend. She didn’t need to go to kindergarten, so she could sleep longer. Jiang Xiaoman opened her eyes in a daze, then continued lying down and wanted to continue sleeping.<br>
But the system wouldn’t let that happen!<br>
The system did not need to sleep, which meant it stayed up all night suffering from the loss of the critical main mission item.<br>
Host, you finally woke up!!!<br>
“Host, it’s time to get up.” The system’s tone was anxious. “A sleepy kid is not a good kid.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman grunted, turned over, and continued to sleep.<br>
The system almost cried.<br>
It was really making the whole system-kind lose face. It couldn’t even handle one little brat!<br>
If it had known things would be like this, it would’ve acted a bit fierce when it was first bound to its host and scared her a little. It won’t be like how it was now, lacking any kind of dignity!<br>
Ah ah ah, no no no, system. You have to show the dignity of an elder!<br>
“Host, This System is warning you. If you still don’t get up, I’m going to spank you!”<br>
Xiaoman finally woke up after hearing this.<br>
She immediately sat up, her reaction bigger than the system’s. But the focus of her attention was on another part of the system’s words…<br>
“Brother System, do you have hands now?”<br>
“…” It was really going to get so angry it would materialize!<br>
Host, do you act so horribly to others?<br>
Are you doing this on purpose?<br>
She may be a villainess, but why is her knife pointed to her own people?! The system was very angry.<br>
The system ignored her words and continued, “Host, there’s something very important I’m going to have you do today. Listen well. Our main mission item has been lost. You have to get it back.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was confused. She grabbed her hair, making her messy hair even messier.<br>
“What main mission item?”<br>
“!!!”<br>
Have you forgotten what the main mission item is?!<br>
What is in your head nowadays?!<br>
The system forced itself to be patient and said, “It’s the crescent-shaped jade pendant, remember? Last night after you fell asleep, your Grandma took it away. We have to find the jade pendant.”<br>
So it turned out to be that thing, Jiang Xiaoman finally understood.<br>
She played with her fingers and said in a very low voice, “If Grandma took it, then just let her have it. I don’t like wearing it…”<br>
She had actually wanted to say that for a long time.<br>
The system always had her wear it on her body. Did it know how painful it was to wear such a cold thing on her on such a cold day?!<br>
It was really freezing!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman didn’t like it. She only liked her Grandma’s warm hands.<br>
“No, you must get it back.” The system couldn’t bear it anymore. “That’s my lifeblood!”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman blinked, “What is a lifeblood?”<br>
“Lifeblood is… lifeblood is lifeblood! It’s my life! It’s my everything! I can’t live without it!” The system broke down. “Host, please, I beg you?”<br>
“Wow—” Jiang Xiaoman was shocked and asked again. “Brother System, now you can even die?”<br>
“……!!!”<br>
Host, you’re doing this on purpose, right? Right?!<br>
Yes, it did not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. It did not need anything. It did not have any physical form, and it could not die!<br>
But its life was almost over now!<br>
If Jiang Xiumei ruthlessly destroyed the jade pendant, it really would disappear!<br>

<p>Host, You’re Too Much!! (3)<br>
Ah, ah, ah. Host, do you know how serious this matter is?!<br>
“Host, I’m serious. This matter is really important. If you don’t go—”<br>
The system still wanted to scare her, but after thinking about it, even “death” was not a particularly amazing thing in its host’s eyes. So what else would threaten her? Nothing!<br>
The system was so angry it almost had a heart attack.<br>
This was because she was too annoying back then, so it kept telling her all those things about it not being a real existence. Now, even its life did not work as a bargaining chip.<br>
What suffering.<br>
The system learned from its failure and said nothing else, intending to just continue with the carrot and the stick.<br>
【Hidden mission: Get the jade pendant back. This concerns the main mission, Host, please take this seriously!! [Takingouthandkerchiefandwipingtears.jpg]<br>
Reward: 50 points】<br>
Fifty points was a huge sum of money for Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Ever since she was little, the only time she had ever been awarded 50 points was when Yu Wencheng was giving them one million yuan.<br>
Logically speaking, this reward should be enough to tempt her.<br>
But her attention was attracted by something else.<br>
“Wow-” Jiang Xiaoman was surprised. “Brother System, what is that crying little person?”<br>
“…” It denotes sadness!<br>
“It’s so fun. It can even move around! Can you send me another one?”<br>
“…it’s an emoticon!” The system gritted its teeth.<br>
“Why have you never used it before? It’s so cute.”<br>
“…” That’s because she made it so angry it acted without thinking!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman marveled at the emoticon for a long time. She felt that it was very cute and wanted to play with it too.<br>
The system said that she would be able to use them in the future. After she goes online, it would be everywhere. Worry not. She would have what she wanted. The most important thing right now was to get the mission item back. Otherwise, it won’t survive until that time comes.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had no choice but to bring her attention back.<br>
She continued talking in a low voice, still wanting to decline. “But, Grandma is so fierce. I do not dare to take it… She took it away secretly, so she must have hidden it.”<br>
You just do not want to go, right? Ah, naïve little devil. Adults have been using this trick forever.<br>
The system did not say anything else. It gritted its teeth and increased the rewards.<br>
【Hidden mission: Get the jade pendant back. This concerns the main mission, Host. Please take this seriously!! [Takingouthandkerchiefandwipingtears.jpg] [Takingouthandkerchiefandwipingtears.jpg]<br>
Reward: 70 points】<br>
Did you say you wanted more emoticons? Here, have some just for you!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was taken aback.<br>
She watched the emoticons for a long time, but this time her attention was not fully on them but also on the reward.<br>
Whoa, there were actually 70 points. That’s so many! She would have to make so many children cry to earn that many points.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very interested.<br>
But was it telling her to steal Grandma’s things? She didn’t dare to.<br>
“But…”<br>
【Hidden mission: Get the jade pendant back. This concerns the main mission, Host, please take this seriously!!<br>
Reward: 80 points】<br>
“……”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was still hesitating, and the system gritted its teeth all the way, raising the reward straight to 100!<br>
This concerned its life. Screw the rules!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was really surprised.<br>
She was stunned for a long time. Her clever head received inspiration, and she played with her fingers while saying, “Grandma is so fierce and good at beating people up. If I stole her things, she would definitely hit me. After thinking about it, I think it’s still too difficult for me. One hundred points are not enough. Why don’t you give me 800 points?”<br>
This way, she would be left with a lot of points even after paying back her debt!<br>
There was no helping it. After all, she was just too smart and observant. She could learn from analogies and easily apply what she had learned before!<br>
The system was really angry. “In your dreams! Don’t even think about it!”<br>
She was starting to go to the roof and take out the tiles!2<br>
Host, you’re really, really too much!! I won’t give in anymore!<br>
Finally, they reached an agreement for 100 points, and Jiang Xiaoman went to steal the jade pendant.<br>

<p>Artificial Idiocy (1)<br>
Jiang Xiumei was very fierce. Even though Xiaoman already promised the system to steal the jade pendant, she didn’t dare act unbridled.<br>
She dragged things out for days without showing any movement, making the system anxious.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman took the initiative to do side missions, making little children cry and dominating the kindergarten for a while, earning 20 points. Even so, it wouldn’t make the system happy.<br>
The system said, “Host, if you don’t get the jade pendant back, I’ll die in front of you!”<br>
What good was making little kids cry? How could the jade pendant be compared to making some children cry?<br>
Host, you’re getting more intelligent and disobedient. Do you think this system can’t see through your act?<br>
The children of humanity were terrible existences.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said quietly, “Brother System, you were never like this before.”<br>
All he talked about was life and death now. How scary.<br>
“Do you think I’m making trouble on purpose? I haven’t cried, I haven’t made a fuss, and I haven’t hung myself yet,” the system cried out.<br>
“What does making trouble on purpose mean?”<br>
The system became frustrated and sighed, “Host, you’re so rebellious and disobedient now. I can’t control you anymore. Remember, if you can’t get the jade pendant back, our friendship will end here.”<br>
“Why?”<br>
Why, why, why? Do you think we’re playing One Hundred Thousand Whys1?!<br>
The system gritted its teeth, “Because never again will there be a system as stupid and naïve as I am, bugged and bound to a little brat. Never! I am the shame of the system world! I deserve this!”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman immediately comforted it. “How could that be? Brother System is amazing. Didn’t you say that you’re better than artificial intelligence, the crystallization of the power of science, the master of fate, an existence sought after by everyone? You said this before.”<br>
“No, I am an artificial idiocy2.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman did not dare to say anything else.<br>
Even though she still didn’t fully understand why the system acted like this, she understood that Brother System had collapsed.<br>
In order not to lose her system friend, she decided to act as soon as possible.<br>
The system directed her to wait until Jiang Xiumei left the house on an errand.<br>
They did not know where Xiumei hid the jade pendant but generally speaking, the more valuable the thing is, the better it would be hidden.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman started from Jiang Xiumei’s bedroom.<br>
In the last two nights, Xiaoman, who had already gotten used to sleeping alone, came to sleep with Jiang Xiumei to find the jade pendant. Xiaoman said that she missed Grandma and wanted to snuggle with her, making Jiang Xiumei very happy.<br>
After secretly procuring the key to the closet, she opened it and rummaged inside. Jiang Xiaoman searched for a long time but did not manage to find anything.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was too tired to cry.<br>
It was easy to turn things upside down, but it was difficult to put them back in place. She tidied them back with much effort and tiredly sat on the floor panting afterward.<br>
“Host, look again. There’s not a safe here, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find,” the system said.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried and said, “Okay.”<br>
Xiaoman had searched too hard just now, so Grandma would definitely be able to tell. She would get a beating whether she found the jade pendant or not.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman felt like crying when she thought of the beating to come.<br>
But she had already promised the system, so she had to do it.<br>
Since she was going to be beaten anyway, she didn’t need to hold back anymore.<br>
Basing it on her habit when hiding things, she took a small shovel and went to dig holes in the yard. This was how she hid things back in the village: digging a hole and putting an iron box inside. This was a trick that Grandma taught her.<br>
Since she couldn’t find it anywhere in the house, maybe Grandma dug a hole to hide it.<br>
She dug holes until she was half dead tired, but it was all in vain. Jiang Xiaoman didn’t want to move anymore.<br>
She was really, really, really tired.<br>
However, things did not just end there.<br>

<p>Artificial Idiocy (2)<br>
Because Jiang Xiumei saw the mess in the yard when she came home, and instantly became furious.<br>
“Jiang Xiaoman!!! What are you doing?!?!”<br>
Jiang Xiumei was furious. Seeing the yard full of holes, she almost fainted from anger. “What are you doing? Do you think you’re a mouse? What are you doing digging holes?”<br>
Jiang Xiumei was very angry, and Jiang Xiaoman received a beating in the yard.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman already expected this beating long ago and was very cooperative. Every time Grandma yelled, Xiaoman also yelled. After Jiang Xiumei felt that she had spanked her enough, she finally stopped.<br>
Who would’ve thought that after entering the house, Jiang Xiumei was once again surprised by the mess all over the floor?<br>
“Jiang Xiaoman! What are you doing? Are you turning Grandma’s house upside down? What are you trying to do?”<br>
What happened to this child today? Why was she so naughty?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman felt very guilty and said in a low voice, “I wasn’t! I was just randomly turning things upside down. I was definitely not looking for something!”<br>
Upon hearing this, Jiang Xiumei’s eyebrows immediately twisted, and she sharply asked, “What are you looking for?”<br>
“I-I’m not…” Xiaoman’s voice became quieter and quieter.<br>
She couldn’t sell out Brother System. She couldn’t betray her friend.<br>
She could only endure all the tears and pain herself.<br>
But Grandma had just spanked just now, so she wouldn’t be eaten again… right?<br>
Of course.<br>
Not.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman received another spanking.<br>
It was a harsh spanking.<br>
Jiang Xiumei was furious.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was looking for something. What else could it be if not the jade pendant?<br>
Xiumei knew that the kid had big ideas, could think about all kinds of things, and was very bold. But she never expected her to have such a big idea.<br>
The jade pendant was gone, and she flipped over the closet and wardrobe by herself to look for it!<br>
Jiang Xiumei panicked.<br>
She also had a guilty conscience. She thought that the child was still young and wouldn’t take this matter to heart, so she chose to hide it. Who would’ve thought that she was so precocious?<br>
This made it impossible for her to return the jade pendant.<br>
Maybe one day she would randomly come up with an idea and actually glean some clues from it.<br>
Jiang Xiumei gave her a harsh spanking, wanting to make her give up.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried and howled. It really hurt.<br>
Grandma didn’t love her anymore! Wah wah wah!<br>
Jiang Xiumei scolded her while spanking, “Jiang Xiaoman, why didn’t I realize before that you could come up with such big ideas, so capable at making trouble? Now all you do is cause trouble every day. Do you know how difficult it was to clean up this house? Back then, all you did was break plates every day when playing. I’ve never seen a child as naughty as you!”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman wouldn’t back down. She cried out loud and did not forget to talk back.<br>
“You said before that you’ve never seen a kid as cute as me!”<br>
“I was blind!” Papapa! She was spanked again.<br>
Jiang Xiumei calmed down and asked, “What were you looking for?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was also very angry. Once she was furious, she didn’t care about anything else. She angrily said, “Grandma, you’re horrible! Not only did you take my jade pendant, but you also beat me! Wahh! I want my jade pendant! I want my jade pendant!”<br>
It was as she expected.<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s face turned really dark.<br>
After a moment of silence, Xiumei coaxed the child and asked, “The jade pendant is too precious. You do not understand its importance. I’m just afraid that you would accidentally break it, so I’m keeping it safe for you. I’ll return it to you later…”<br>
“But the system said that it is its lifeblood!”<br>
So someone instigated her to do this. Jiang Xiumei gritted her teeth and asked, “Whole the hell is this system? That bastard dares to corrupt our Xiaoman. I’m going to smash his head!”<br>
“The system is the system. The system is my friend!!!”<br>
Jiang Xiumei was really pissed at this person called the system. She used to hear Xiaoman mention its name every day, and now its evil claws reached even inside this house.</p>

<p>Artificial Idiocy (3)<br>
One day, she’s going to pull it aside and give it a beating.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman refused to say anything no matter what. Jiang Xiumei was also helpless and angrily said, “Wow, Jiang Xiaoman. You’ve never been so disobedient before, and you never talked back to me. You’re not my dear baby anymore.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman snorted and said while sobbing, “Yes! I’m rebellious now!”<br>
“……”<br>
It was not a good thing for a child to be too smart. At times like this, it could make someone really furious.<br>
Jiang Xiumei smiled furiously.<br>
Xiaoman cried miserably, but she did not coax her.<br>
This matter was too serious, and she needed to teach her a lesson. Otherwise, in the future she would go to the roof and take off the tiles.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried all night, feeling very sad and aggrieved. The more she thought about it, the sadder she got.<br>
She was now the little cabbage in the ground, swaying in the wind and drenched by rain, wanted by no one.<br>
Grandma didn’t want her anymore.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried all night.<br>
The system couldn’t bear it anymore. It comforted her and said, “Host, don’t be sad. We’ll find other opportunities in the future—”<br>
“What else are you looking for? I’m not going to look for it anymore!” Jiang Xiaoman said angrily. “I’m going to run away from home!”<br>
“Host.” The system said, “This world is very harsh. Children who run away from home will not meet a good end. Calm down!”<br>
Kidnappers were very terrible, and the system was really afraid that she would get hot-headed and actually ran away.<br>
For now, it did not seem like Jiang Xiumei had any plans to destroy the jade pendant.<br>
Oh well, they’ll just move on step by step. If it could survive an extra day, count it as an extra day of blessing. The system was prepared to accept its fate.<br>
Right now, relying on the host to get back the jade pendant seemed to be a fool’s errand.<br>
She couldn’t get the jade pendant back, and she also couldn’t run away from home. Wasn’t this such a hellish start?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman fell into thought and finally calmed down a bit.<br>
She still had another way. This was something that Jiang Xing taught her; rely on your parent at home, and rely on your friends outside. Grandma didn’t want her anymore, but she still had friends!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very sad.<br>
She got spanked twice.<br>
This had never happened before.<br>
Even when Grandma was really furious before, it was just a loud thunder with little rain3. But this time, it was different.<br>
She was really spanking her! It hurt!!<br>
Even when she howled with all her might, it didn’t work!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman didn’t like Grandma anymore!! Wahh!!<br>
She was so angry that she wanted to run away from home.<br>
But she didn’t want to run away from home. She just wanted to hate Grandma a little, not forever.<br>
She felt that she could only ask her little friend to take her in.<br>
She wanted to let Grandma know that children also had feelings!<br>
She wanted to let her grandma know that children also had a temper!<br>
She couldn’t just spank her all she wanted!<br>
She was going to show her up good!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman made up her mind and used the trick the system taught her, ‘soft mouth, short hands4’. She was going to bring a lot of delicious food for her friend Yu Qingshi. That way, it would be hard for him to reject her request.<br>
She was going to stay at his place for a few days.<br>
To win him over, she used on point to exchange ten candies from the system.<br>
This candy was costly. It was the most expensive candy the system had, and she couldn’t bear to eat them.<br>
She planned to give them all to him.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried and prepared her stuff, secretly stuffing some clothes in her schoolbag. She was waiting for Monday to go to school.<br>
She was very sad and angry.<br>
When she arrived at the kindergarten, she wanted to give Yu Qingshi the sweets. However, she found out that he did not come to school today.<br>

Eat someone’s food and your mouth becomes soft (so you can’t scold them), take someone’s gift and your hand becomes short (so you can’t hit them). It’s very wordy and awkward though (the raw is only 2 x 4 word long) so I’m shortening them to this.</p>

<p>Who was More Miserable? (1)<br>
It was so strange.<br>
Yu Qingshi had always come to school more punctually than her. He was not deterred by wind nor rain. Today was not the weekend, so why was he not at school? Could he have overslept?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman decided for a little while longer.<br>
She held candies in her hand, and she struggled to refrain from eating them, but she still had to save them for Yu Qingshi. If he came after she ate them, how would she win him over?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman suppressed her desire to eat the candies. She waited and waited, but even at noon, he had not arrived.<br>
Xiaoman understood now that Yu Qingshi was absent today.<br>
At that time, the children were all taking a nap, but she couldn’t sleep because her mind was full of all kinds of thoughts. So, she ran to the teacher’s office.<br>
“Teacher Yang, why is Yu Qingshi not coming to the kindergarten today?” she asked.<br>
“Oh, him. He has something at home. His father already called to ask for an excused absence. He is not coming today,” Teacher Yang answered.<br>
“Ah…okay.” Xiaoman forcefully held back her disappointment and left the office.<br>
Could she still run away from home?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman felt that her plan was going to die before fruition. She could not carry it out anymore and make Grandma understand her.<br>
Why was she so unlucky?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman angrily ate the candies. They were very delicious. She wanted to eat more after eating them and almost couldn’t stop herself from exchanging more points for them.<br>
The system tried to lure her by saying, “Host, this candy is delicious. If you still want to eat some, I can give them to you for free, as long as –”<br>
“No!” Jiang Xiaoman refused very firmly. “Do you think I’m a fool? Grandma said that I should not take other people’s things easily. You’re not going to fool me!”<br>
“…” Why was she always smarter than her age in such strange aspects?!<br>
The system was too angry to speak.<br>
–<br>
In the evening, school ended.<br>
Right now, Jiang Xiaoman was still thinking about how to sneakily run away from home. Soon, Grandma would come to pick her up. Xiaoman didn’t want to go with her.<br>
Xiaoman wanted to let Grandma know that she was not that easily coaxed!<br>
However, the one who unexpectedly came to pick her up was not Jiang Xiumei but Jiang Xing.<br>
“Uncle!” Xiaoman’s milky voice could not hold back its happiness when she saw him. At first, she was overjoyed, then her mouth flattened, and she started to cry. “You don’t know, do you? I got spanked when you were not home yesterday.”<br>
“……”<br>
Was that not a normal occurrence?<br>
Jiang Xing perfunctorily coaxed her, then picked her up and left.<br>
The way they went was not home.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman strangely said, “Uncle, are you unable to stand Grandma anymore, and taking me to run away from home?”<br>
“Little girl, what nonsense are you saying?” Jiang Xing said. “We’re going to see your little friend.”<br>
“Is he troubled again?” Jiang Xiaoman, who had experienced it before, asked.<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“No wonder he didn’t come to kindergarten today,” Jiang Xiaoman sighed heavily. “He can skip school when he feels troubled.”<br>
“…” Jiang Xing laughed angrily and fiercely glared at her.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s problem was really pitiful.<br>
When his syndrome didn’t act up, he was just like a normal person. He was even smarter and more obedient than Xiaoman. But once he was stimulated, no kind of treatment would work. Even Gods and Buddhas would find it hard to help him.<br>
“Coax him like last time, understand? Boss Yu is almost crying right now.”<br>
“Okay. Poor Uncle Yu.”<br>
When they arrived at the Yu family’s house, the sky had turned completely dark.<br>
This time there was no mess or food scattered on the floor, only silence.<br>
But there was also an old couple next to Yu Wencheng.<br>
This grandpa and grandma were Yu Qingshi’s grandparents. Because the problem this time was too big, both of them also came here.<br>
During the weekend, Yu Qingshi’s mother called from the mental hospital, saying that she wanted to meet her child.</p>

<p>Who was More Miserable? (2)<br>
After consulting the doctor, he said that she was stable and would not harm the child. Only then did Yu Wencheng took Yu Qingshi there.<br>
At the beginning, everything was fine, but then Yu Qingshi’s mother went crazy again. She beat Yu Qingshi and scolded him, telling him to go and that she did not want him.<br>
Fortunately, Yu Wencheng was watching from the side, so it didn’t develop into a big incident. He immediately took the child away.<br>
But Yu Qingshi was stimulated by the encounter, and he remained silent after returning home and still had not recovered. As a last resort, they called Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Yu Wencheng’s heart was really almost crushed.<br>
Seeing her and Jiang Xing, Yu Wencheng was relieved. He said with red eyes, “I’m really troubling you guys every time….”<br>
“It’s fine, it’s fine.” Jiang Xing put Xiaoman down and told her to follow Yu Wencheng upstairs.<br>
Their Xiaoman was really amazing!<br>
This time, it was still coming in through Miaomiao’s hole.<br>
After the experience last time, Yu Wencheng acted smarter. He quietly had the hole widened so it would be easier for him to enter. But later, his son discovered it, so Yu Wencheng had to return it to a smaller size that could only fit Miaomiao.<br>
Adults still couldn’t go in, but Xiaoman could.<br>
When she entered, it was dark like last time.<br>
The sky outside was already dark, and inside, the room was even darker.<br>
This time, Jiang Xiaoman was already familiar with the situation. “Pa!” She turned on the lights. She opened the closet again, but this time Yu Qingshi was not inside.<br>
She rubbed her head and thought for a bit, then immediately laid on the ground and rolled under the bed.<br>
Roll roll roll. When she stopped, her eyes just happen to meet Yu Qingshi’s eyes. A pair of big eyes staring at a pair of smaller eyes.<br>
Yu Qingshi had been crying silently, and when he saw the little devil, his eyes glared at her angrily, wanting to drive her away from his territory.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was really annoying.<br>
And why could she find his hiding place every time?!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked him, “Why are you crying?”<br>
Yu Qingshi did not speak.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked him again, “Why are you hiding?”<br>
Yu Qingshi still did not speak.<br>
Xiaoman was reminded of her own situation when she watched him silently shed tears. Jiang Xiaoman felt that she was too miserable.<br>
Not only was she beaten by her grandmother, but she also couldn’t run away from home, and now she had to come here to coax a kid.<br>
But Yu Qingshi still ignored her. She was too miserable.<br>
Thinking about it, Jiang Xiaoman felt her sadness well up and started sobbing, “Haah, all children in the world share the same suffering. Whenever they get disobedient, they will get spanked. You must have gotten spanked, right?”<br>
Yu Qingshi was still planning to ignore her, but she really was too good at slandering people. He could only try to explain, “I didn’t get spanked!”<br>
“Then why are you crying? You should only be crying when you got spanked.”<br>
He was different!<br>
He had never been spanked!<br>
He wasn’t like her!<br>
Yu Qingshi said angrily, “Dad never spanked me.”<br>
“Ah, so your Dad must not love you.”<br>
Yu Qingshi was confused. What kind of logic was this?<br>
“Spanking is a sign of affection. Scolding is a sign of love. It is not happy to not be spanked or scolded.”<br>
“…” Yu Qingshi angrily thought for a while and said, “My Mom beats me and scolds me, but she doesn’t want me.”<br>
“So that’s what you were crying about? What, isn’t this nothing?” Jiang Xiaoman looked at him disdainfully.<br>
Yu Qingshi was really sad.<br>
But he also did not like Jiang Xiaoman’s act! She looked so impertinent! She was making him look like a child who was just brattily throwing a tantrum. He wasn’t!<br>
Yu Qingshi endured his anger and grievance, saying, “Is this thing not serious enough?!”<br>
“Not only do I not have a mother, but I also do not have a father.” Jiang Xiaoman said. “There’s only Grandma and Uncle. When Grandma beats someone, she is very fierce. She beats Uncle, and she also beats me. What are you crying for? I’ll give you Grandma for two days, and you’ll understand what miserable days are. But I can only lend her to you for two days. You’ll have to return her afterward.”</p>

<p>Who was More Miserable? (3)<br>
She kept talking and almost cried again.<br>
She was too miserable.<br>
Yu Qingshi felt like she had thrown him into the ditch.<br>
Seeing her face covered in tears, he suddenly felt like… he wasn’t that miserable after all?<br>
Talking about misery, Jiang Xiaoman was miserable.<br>
But every day, she was so impudent and did not seem like a child who had been living a miserable life. She was very brazen. Sometimes, he felt like beating her.<br>
Yu Qingshi hesitated for a while and asked, “When Grandma beats you, does it hurt?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried even more aggrievedly, “It hurts, it hurts so much that I can’t sleep all night.”<br>
It was too miserable.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s gloom was almost completely gone.<br>
He suddenly felt that he didn’t know what else he should be crying for.<br>
But now that Yu Qingshi was not crying anymore, it was Jiang Xiaoman’s turn to cry.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried and said, “I’m already this miserable, getting spanked and scolded, but I’m still told to come here to comfort you. Do you still want to cry?”<br>
“Oh, no. Not anymore.”<br>
“But I want to cry.” The more she thought about it, the sadder she became.<br>
Xiaoman couldn’t stop crying. Her red and swollen eyes became even more red. She looked so miserable.<br>
“Grandma took my stuff and wouldn’t return it, and she wouldn’t let me find it. When I tried to, she scolded me and beat me. I got beaten twice! Why are adults such unreasonable brutes? They won’t allow children to speak their opinions. Are we not allowed to think? Just a couple of words, and they hit us. Waaah!”<br>
“…” Suddenly, Yu Qingshi did not know what else to say.<br>
Compared to this, he thought that he really was too happy.<br>
His father never messed with his stuff because he knew that he would not be happy. He also never beat him or scold him.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried for a while and then slowly rolled out from the bed.<br>
She sat on the ground, sobbing, and waved her hand at Yu Qingshi. “Get out first. I have something to discuss with you.”<br>
Yu Qingshi hesitated for a while and came out.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said, “I want to run away from home for two days. Can you take me in? I only have one friend, and your house is also the only one I’ve visited. If you don’t help me, I would have nowhere else to go and can only sleep on the streets. The system said that this world is very cruel. If you sleep on the streets, you will meet bad guys. Only you can help me. Waaah!!”<br>
How could she be so bold to run away from home?! He never even thought about something like that!<br>
Out of his loyalty towards friends, Yu Qingshi hesitatingly nodded his head.<br>
Anyways, he had a lot of rooms in his house. It would not be a problem to take her in for two days.<br>
But give an inch, and she wanted a mile.<br>
“Tonight, I’ll sleep together with you. I can tell you a story. I can tell a lot of stories. There’s the story about the Mama Tiger; that one is the scariest. She specializes in eating children like you.”<br>
“……”<br>
Yu Qingshi was very territorial. He was already making a big concession by letting her come to his room twice, but she still wanted to sleep with him?<br>
And there’s still the Mama Tiger…What the hell was that?<br>
Yu Qingshi was terrified.<br>
Half of it was because Mama Tiger ate children, and half of it was because Jiang Xiaoman would be sneaking under his blanket at night.<br>
The scared Yu Qingshi burst into tears and quickly went to find his father. “Waaah, Dad! I want to sleep with you tonight!!” He did not want to sleep with Jiang Xiaoman!!<br>
His son was holding him tightly and wouldn’t let go of his hands no matter what. Yu Wencheng’s old tears burst out and he said, “Okay, come sleep with Dad.”<br>
This Jiang Xiaoman is really too amazing!</p>

<p>Don’t Bully the Poor System (1)<br>
In the end, Jiang Xiaoman wasn’t able to successfully run away from home.<br>
Although Yu Qingshi had promised to take her in for two days, Jiang Xing was there, and it was impossible for him to let her stay. In the end, Jiang Xing and Jiang Xiaoman went back home to Jiang Xiumei.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very unhappy; she pouted and stayed silent the entire way home.<br>
Jiang Xing said, “Your mouth is pouting so much we can use it to hang bottles from.”<br>
“Hmph!” Jiang Xiaoman wiped her tears, feeling that it was a waste for her to come running all the way here for nothing. She felt like a tool, thrown aside as soon as her role was done.<br>
Yu Qingshi and Uncle Yu were happy, but she got nothing.<br>
And if she went home, she might still get scolded by Grandma.<br>
“Uncle, why did Grandma take my jade pendant?” Jiang Xiaoman asked.<br>
Jiang Xing was surprised. He didn’t expect his mother to take away Xiaoman’s jade pendant.<br>
After hesitating for a while, Jiang Xing asked, “Xiaoman, you… If one day you have a father, will you leave your Uncle and Grandma?”<br>
“Why would I have to leave you? Can’t we just stay together forever?”<br>
“Hmm…That’s also true. Ah well, we’ll talk about it when the time comes,” Jiang Xing said. “Your Grandma loves you very much. She beats and scolds you, which means she loves you. If she took your jade pendant, then just let her have it. If you really want one, I’ll buy you a new one later.”<br>
“But I only want that one.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman didn’t want it, but the system said that if they didn’t get it back, it really would die. Although she was also very curious how the system would die, she couldn’t really watch and let it die.<br>
If it was dead, she would have no friends anymore.<br>
Sigh, such a hassle.<br>
Why did she have to suffer through all this at such a young age?<br>
“That’s fine, Uncle will talk to your Grandma once we’re home.”<br>
Only then did Xiaoman stop crying, and her tears turned into a smile.<br>
She was very tired once they got home, and after washing up, she immediately laid down on the bed and fell asleep. She was still sobbing in her sleep; her nose and eyes were red from crying, and her face was full of tear marks.<br>
Jiang Xing looked for Jiang Xiumei to talk about the jade pendant.<br>
“Mom, if Xiaoman wants the jade pendant, just give it to her. If you don’t want to let her go, then you should spoil her. Children are clumsy and mischievous, and she had always liked to break plates ever since she was very small. But wouldn’t it be better to let her break them? This way, she would only be able to blame herself and not you.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei didn’t like listening to her son preach to her, but after thinking about it again, she felt that what he said made sense.<br>
By taking away the jade pendant, wasn’t she also helping Xiaoman keep it safe?<br>
Xiaoman was getting even more and more incapable of staying still lately. Perhaps she would get careless and break the pendant, or feel that it didn’t look that good and throw it away.<br>
But Jiang Xiumei was still somewhat worried.<br>
“What if her biological parents cpme? What if they want to take her away?” Jiang Xiumei asked anxiously.<br>
Jiang Xing laughed and said, “Mom, honestly, I’ve been to many places with the logistics team the past year. There are many people who have lost their children. I’ve seen a lot of missing people posters on the road and posted on walls. There are many people looking for children, but I’ve never seen one looking for Xiaoman.”<br>
Her heart was still restless, but Jiang Xiumei’s complexion became a bit better.<br>
Hearing what he said, her restless mind calmed down a lot.<br>
He was right.<br>
They had raised her for so many years, but they’ve never heard of a family coming to look for their lost child.<br>
The jade pendant looked very valuable. If something like this could be given for a baby to wear, the family must be pretty well off, or at the very least, better off than them.</p>

<p>Don’t Bully the Poor System (2)<br>
It wasn’t like their family lacked money. If someone like that lost their child but didn’t look for her, then they probably didn’t want her in the first place.<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s fist hardened as she thought about that.<br>
On one hand, Xiaoman was her treasure, and she didn’t want anyone to come and steal her. On the other hand, if no one really came for her, she would become weirdly protective of Xiaoman. She felt that her family had no eyes and couldn’t recognize a treasure.<br>
Their Xiaoman was so cute, but they didn’t want her!<br>
After all, Jiang Xiumei had lived for a long time and seen all kinds of things. She had also suffered from her parents favoring the son. Maybe Xiaoman’s biological parents also did not want girls, only boys.<br>
The more Jiang Xiumei thought about it, the angrier she was, but at the same time, she became more relieved.<br>
Jiang Xiumei said, “You’re right, I’m just needlessly worrying1. I’ll return the jade pendant to Xiaoman tomorrow. It belongs to her.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei did as she said and returned it to Xiaoman.<br>
When Xiaoman woke up the next day, she found the jade pendant back around her neck.<br>
She was surprised for a while, thinking that she was still dreaming.<br>
But that cold feeling when she touched it really belonged to her jade pendant!<br>
She happily said, “Brother System! Your lifeblood is back!”<br>
“……” The system had long known about it.<br>
It didn’t need to sleep, so it saw when Jiang Xiumei came in to return the jade pendant.<br>
“Host, you must keep it safe, understand?” the system said seriously.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman nodded vigorously. She blinked her eyes and asked, “So, how about the points?”<br>
“……”<br>
Aaaaaahhhh!!!<br>
How did it come to this!?<br>
For a system to be squeezed dry by a brat, no one would believe it!<br>
【Ding Dong! Jade pendant successfully retrieved. Reward: 100 points】<br>
But before Jiang Xiaoman could grin, she could only watch in shock as the system deducted her hard-earned points.<br>
【Points received. Balance: -660 points】<br>
“!!!” She didn’t want to work hard to earn points anymore!<br>
No matter how much she earned, it would go back to the system anyways, and she would have nothing to do with it at all!<br>
How would she still have any fighting spirit this way?!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman thought that angrily while feeling very sad.<br>
No wonder her Uncle wanted to be a boss. As a boss, he could let others do the work for him, and just sit back and collect the money without having to do anything himself.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman also wanted to become rich now. She wanted to become a boss. Waah!!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried for a while, but quickly settled her mood and prepared to go to school.<br>
As soon as she got out of the bedroom, she saw Jiang Xiumei preparing her breakfast.<br>
She sat down obediently. After thinking about it for a while, she took the initiative to kiss Jiang Xiumei.<br>
“Grandma, you are so kind.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei was really happy inside, but she said, “Who was it that said I was a bad person before. I give you a little kindness and you remember how good I am. If I didn’t give you then, hmph hmph, who knows how you scold me in your heart.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman fell for her bluff. Her mouth immediately flattened as she explained in a low voice, “I didn’t! I like Grandma very much! Although I was angry before, wanted to run away from home and wanted to give Grandma to Yu Qingshi for a few days, but I told him that he would have to return to you later! Children don’t hold grudges, I only planned to be upset at Grandma for two days!”<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s face turned green.<br>
She gritted her teeth, wanting to punch someone.<br>
But thinking about it, she had just given her a spanking. Another one so soon after would not be good for the child, so she could only secretly write down this matter to get back at some other day.<br>
–<br>
After eating the breakfast Grandma made, Jiang Xiaoman happily went to school.<br>
The system got its lifeblood back and finally regained its vitality. It was no longer just flapping its mouth all the time saying it was gonna die.<br>

<p>Don’t Bully the Poor System (3)<br>
Not only did it not want to die anymore, but it had also started giving out tasks again.<br>
This time, the system reignited its fighting spirit. It would not waste Jiang Xiaoman’s energy by distracting her with side missions anymore.<br>
The main mission was the priority!<br>
Make Yu Qingshi cry, make Yu Qingshi cry, make Yu Qingshi cry!<br>
Do everything to draw the villain’s hatred; that was the number one priority!<br>
【Main mission:<br>
Make Yu Qingshi cry once. Reward: 5 points;<br>
Make Yu Qingshi cry twice. Reward: 10 points;<br>
Make Yu Qingshi cry thrice. Reward: 15 points;<br>
……】<br>
The system gave Xiaoman a bunch of tasks about Yu Qingshi at once, enough to make him cry for a whole year.<br>
Of course, the number of points rewarded was also very large.<br>
However, Jiang Xiaoman was unmoved.<br>
She was now a child who had seen the world and had even gotten a hundred points. Was she still lacking some one, two, five, or ten points?<br>
Hmph, she wouldn’t do this kind of hard and tiring work.<br>
If she was going to do something, then she would do something big! She was waiting for the system to give her a task with a large number of points!<br>
She had learned to be smart!<br>
The system wanted to cry.<br>
It only knew that humans were called the spirit of all things, relying on their own intelligence and power to change the world.<br>
With perseverance and tenacious vitality, they brought extraordinary miracles to life in this world.<br>
It knew all of that.<br>
But, it didn’t know that the children of humans were also very terrifying!<br>
In no time, it was already made hopeless by a brat who was just born yesterday, and lost everything down to its underwear!<br>
The system held back its tears and thought seriously for a long, long time.<br>
Its host learned very quickly, was quick to infer, and very observant. Of course, she was also very vicious.<br>
That viciousness was literally carved into her bones, making her the perfect material for the evil villainess from birth. Of course, if this viciousness was not only directed to it all the time, the system would be very happy.<br>
It was a pity that right now it was receiving all the beating by itself, there was no equilibrium.<br>
However, its host was not without weakness.<br>
The common weakness of children was that they easily trust people, and therefore, were easy to deceive.<br>
“Host, I want to tell you a story.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman liked listening to stories the most, and immediately entered a posture of listening obediently2. “Okay, okay.”<br>
“I used to be just a small system, really really small, the kind that can be bullied by anyone. But I was determined to decide my own fate. Thirty years east, thirty years west, don’t bully the poor youths3. With unyielding determination, I finally upgraded into a villain system with a name.”<br>
The system said, “I wasn’t deliberately forcing you to do tasks every day. It’s because if my host doesn’t do tasks, I would be very miserable. There are bigger systems above me that specifically bully us smaller systems. They take my stuff and say that they wouldn’t return it if the tasks aren’t completed. I tried to find them to ask them to return it, but not only did they scold me, but they also beat me! They beat me several times in a day! Tell me, why are big systems so horrible?! Are we small systems not allowed to have an opinion? Do small systems not have any temper?! I just said a few words, and they started hitting me. Waah4…”<br>
“Host, I’m also helpless. I’m really so miserable. Waaah…”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman listened until her eyes bulged out and her mouth hung down.<br>
She never expected that Brother System had such a difficult life, like water surrounded by fire. Those big systems were very bad, even worse than Grandma!<br>
The system was really too miserable!<br>
It must be the most miserable person in the world!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said in sympathy, “Brother System, don’t be afraid. I will help you.”<br>
“Waah. Host, you’re such a good person,” the system cried until snot came out.<br>
Hehehe, if the host could learn and improve every day, can systems not do the same?<br>
The system’s learning capability was also amazing! Crying and sobbing, who can’t do something so simple?</p>

<p>Jiang ”Bully” Xiaoman (1)<br>
Now that Jiang Xiaoman had promised the system to save it from misery, she had to get to work.<br>
But she needed to research how exactly she was supposed to save it.<br>
For Xiaoman, making Yu Qingshi cry was a big problem.<br>
She could already handle the other kids. For example, Ye Jiajia: snatch her stuff, and she would cry. For Zhang Xinhua: snatch his snacks, and he would cry.<br>
There were all kinds of weird methods, although they were just variations of snatching their stuff at the end of the day.<br>
But Yu Qingshi was different.<br>
Sometimes when she had a task from the system, Yu Qingshi would cry for apparently no reason.<br>
Other times, she would try as hard as she could to make him cry, but he still wouldn’t cry.<br>
It was very troublesome.<br>
Xiaoman had a headache.<br>
This morning, she snatched Yu Qingshi’s snacks.<br>
He rarely brought snacks to school, but today he brought some, and they were all the chocolates that she loved to eat so much.<br>
On the one hand, the system gave the tasks, and on the other hand, she really wanted to eat too. Her inner devil and desire defeated her.<br>
After snatching them, Jiang Xiaoman immediately opened the wrappings and stuffed them in her mouth. She purposely showed a smug and impudent attitude and mumbled, “I… I’ve snatched your chokoleit1, wanna cry?”<br>
Yu Qingshi looked at her coldly and shook his head.<br>
His chocolate was snatched, but he didn’t want to cry at all. Seeing her smug face made him very angry, but he didn’t want to cry.<br>
Anyways, if Xiaoman didn’t eat it, Zhang Xinhua would eat it. There was no difference for Yu Qingshi.<br>
So, in the end, Yu Qingshi didn’t cry. But Zhang Xinhua cried for a whole lesson.<br>
Zhang Xinhua thought that he was the most frightening little bully in the kindergarten, but Jiang Xiaoman was worse! She snatched the thing he wanted to snatch! She was terrible!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman felt half happy and half defeated. She put her hands on her waist and loudly said, “You just don’t understand the greatness of candies yet. When I continue to snatch your candies tomorrow, you’re gonna want to cry!”<br>
The chocolate was delicious. Xiaoman still wanted to eat them.<br>
So on the next day, she went to snatch his chocolates again.<br>
She put them in her mouth and taunted him again. Yu Qingshi just silently took out more snacks from the compartment under his desk and gave them to her. “Eat slowly.”<br>
“……”<br>
Yu Qingshi brought her so many candies and chocolates!<br>
Yu Qingshi was a good kid!<br>
His candies were making her conscience uneasy!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman already ate his food, so now she classified Yu Qingshi as one of her own people. Since he was her own, then she must protect him.<br>
Zhang Xinhua, who caught a whiff of food during the break, came to snatch some snacks. But as soon as he opened his mouth, Jiang Xiaoman pushed him away.<br>
“You’re not allowed to snatch his food anymore!”<br>
Zhang Xinhua’s behavior looked very unpleasant in Jiang Xiaoman’s eyes now.<br>
Just because Yu Qingshi had always stayed silent didn’t mean that Zhang Xinhua could always bully him! Look at his thin arms and legs! Meanwhile, Zhang Xinhua was so pudgy. Zhang Xinhua must’ve eaten all his food. That was why Yu Qingshi was so thin!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had to protect him.<br>
Zhang Xinhua opened his mouth wide and then quietly wiped his tears.<br>
He said angrily, “Why? Why are you allowed to snatch them, but I can’t?”<br>
“He and I are friends.”<br>
“He and I are friends, too.”<br>
“It’s different.” Xiaoman fell into a logical conundrum; she couldn’t give a proper explanation. But children were capable of causing trouble without a proper reason.<br>
She loudly said, “Anyways, you can’t snatch his things! If you do, I’m going to beat you up!”<br>
Jiang “Kindergarten Overlord” Xiaoman. So horrible! She actually wanted to beat someone up!<br>
Zhang Xinhua also became very angry and rolled his sleeves up, “Fine! If you hit me, then I’ll hit you back! You can’t defeat me!”<br>
He was white and fat, the kind that Jiang Xiumei liked the most. Xiaoman would definitely not be able to defeat him.<br>
She didn’t actually want to fight him.<br>
“I’m not going to fight you. I can’t win against you,” Jiang Xiaoman honestly said. “I’ll let my uncle come to fight you.”<br>
“……”<br>
Zhang Xinhua was taken aback and finally remembered who Jiang Xiaoman’s uncle was.<br>
Wasn’t he the man that came there with a fierce lion statue last time? Was he going to be like that lion, opening his mouth wide and swallowing one kid with every gulp?<br>
Whoa, so scary!<br>
“Waaah!” Zhang Xinhua was shocked to tears by his imagination.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman stared blankly, wondering why the little fat guy who was still very fierce just now suddenly cried.<br>
But well, if you want to cry, then cry. Who there hadn’t cried at least a few times? She had long been used to it.<br>
There was just one problem she didn’t understand.<br>
“Brother System, why aren’t you giving me any tasks?” Then she could’ve earned points for making Zhang Xinhua cry.<br>
It had forgotten. It had been added recently because of its anger.<br>
It went silent and did not say anything.<br>
Xiaoman was also too ashamed to bully Yu Qingshi again. It was impossible to make him cry anymore. The only one who would cry was probably the system.<br>
The system started to lose its temper again.<br>
It kept talking about how miserable it was, about how Xiaoman was the only one who could save it from its suffering and hoping that she would have a conscience.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had no choice but to continue figuring out a way.<br>
She really couldn’t make Yu Qingshi cry, so she could only discuss it with him so he would cry by himself.<br>

<p>Jiang ”Bully” Xiaoman (2)<br>
After class, during the free activities period, and during the playing session, Jiang Xiaoman kept following him and begged him to cry. She kept begging and begging that she almost cried herself, but he still had not cried yet.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman wiped her eyes and asked with a small crying voice, “Your Mother scolded you and said that she didn’t want you. Don’t you feel sad, don’t you feel very miserable? Why won’t you cry? There’s nothing wrong with children crying. Which child in this world doesn’t cry?”<br>
Why was he different from others?<br>
Yu Qingshi had a good temper. After being pestered by her for a whole day, he didn’t beat her. And he still didn’t beat her when his wound was exposed and instead calmly explained.<br>
Yu Qingshi said, “You have no father and no mother, but you’re not sad. So what should I be sad about? Your Grandma scolded you until you want to run away from home, but you didn’t cry. So why should I cry? I don’t think I have anything to cry about. I’m not miserable at all. But you are, yet you’re always still so strong and optimistic. My Dad said that I have to treat you better and learn more from you. Even if you scare me with the story of the Mama Tiger, I’m not going to cry.”<br>
He pestered his Dad to tell him the story of the Mama Tiger. He then went to the zoo with his Dad and saw the tiger. He finally realized that tigers walked on all four; they cannot disguise themselves as adult humans to eat children.<br>
It was a made-up story used to deceive children. Whoever believed them were fools.<br>
“Waaah!!!” Jiang Xiaoman listened to him and felt sad again. She felt that every word he said was like a knife stabbing into her heart2.<br>
She really was too miserable!<br>
She didn’t want to be strong or optimistic at all!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman ran away while wiping her tears and was very sad all night long.<br>
She decided that she would never talk to Yu Qingshi again. This person was very bad!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman also swore not to eat his chocolates again and that she would not protect him anymore.<br>
But this vow only lasted for one night. The next day, the two reconciled and became friends again.<br>
In fact, Jiang Xiaoman was a very vengeful child. Yu Qingshi made her cry, and she was very angry, but Yu Qingshi truly grasped the trick behind bribing.<br>
He actually brought her so many more delicious foods!<br>
They were really delicious!<br>
Butter cookies, creampuffs, candies, chocolates. There were so many of them, and there were even some that she had never eaten before!<br>
They were really delicious!<br>
If she didn’t eat them, then Zhang Xinhua would eat them.<br>
Xiaoman was unwilling to let that happen, so she could only cry sadly while honestly eating them. She ate as she cried.<br>
Yu Qingshi also apologized, saying that he had said something wrong yesterday. He asked for forgiveness; everyone was still good friends.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very angry. This time she was not mad at Yu Qingshi but at herself.<br>
Why was she so useless, so irresolute? She already wanted to forgive him so much! She sincerely felt that he was a really good person!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said in tears, “Cry with me, and I will forgive you.”<br>
“I can’t cry.” Yu Qingshi normally didn’t get emotional very much, so he really couldn’t cry.<br>
There was actually a way to make him cry, but even if he had to die, he did not want to use that way just to make Xiaoman happy. Unless he really really had to, but right now, they were still far from that point.<br>
Even if he took a couple of thousand steps back and think, the kindergarten was very clean. There were no mice nor insects; they wouldn’t be able to find one even if they looked for them.<br>
Yu Qingshi took out a small bottle the size of his thumb. “Although I don’t know why I must cry, I do have a way.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked him in her crying voice, “What is this?”<br>
“Eucalyptus oil3.” Yu Qingshi didn’t say anything else. He poured a little oil on his fingertips, then proudly rubbed them on his eyelids.<br>
In just a short moment, his eyes went red, and he started shedding tears.<br>
“…” Xiaoman was stunned. “Wow! That’s amazing!!”<br>
This was really good stuff!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman watched him shedding tears then tried it herself. The two children wept as their eyes went red in the wind.<br>
Yu Qingshi asked her as he was shedding his tears, “Is this fine?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had experienced getting teary-eyed in the wind herself. She knew that it didn’t feel comfortable and that his sacrifice was too great. She nodded in tears, “It’s fine.”<br>
…<br>
Yu Qingshi was relieved, and the two of them went to the toilet to wash their eyes.<br>
When there was no one else around, Jiang Xiaoman used the opportunity to ask the system. “Brother System, how about the points?”<br>
Didn’t it say that it would give her points after making Yu Qingshi cry? Why hadn’t it given her the points after such a long time had passed?<br>
“Are you going to default on your debt?” Jiang Xiaoman continued asking reluctantly.<br>
“…” The system was so angry it almost passed out.<br>
Did its host think that since it said that it was an Artificial Idiocy, then it really was an idiot!?!?<br>
How could this kind of trick fool this high IQ system!?!?<br>
Was this kind of trick to fool children the thing that it wanted!?!?<br>
Eucalyptus oil, huh? Humans were really too smart! Its host had really worked hard! It had seen it with its own two eyes!<br>
The system couldn’t stand it anymore!<br>
It couldn’t stand it anymore. It couldn’t just sit back and wait for its doom anymore!<br>
It must press on the attack, turn defeat into victory, and regain control of the initiative!<br>
After thinking about it, the system decided to do something terrible to its host.<br>
Footnote:<br>

3. This isn’t exactly eucalyptus oil, but I don’t think there’s a perfect equivalent in English. A more literal translation would be ‘wind’ essential oil. Eucalyptus oil is one of the ingredients commonly used to make it so it should be the closest equivalent. It makes your skin feel cold/chilly if wind is blown on the area where you apply it (like if you chew mint).</p>

<p>Because She’s Pretty Cute (1)<br>
The system felt that the tasks it gave were not wrong because it was impossible for the system to be wrong. Hence, it had to be somebody else’s fault.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was also not wrong; she earnestly tried to bully Yu Qingshi, but he wasn’t reacting.<br>
His growth had been distorted.<br>
He was no longer the villain who would seek revenge for the smallest of grievances, bargain for every penny, prioritize his personal profits, and whose mood was always changing. He was no longer that evil and cunning villain!<br>
No matter how much Jiang Xiaoman teased him, he would not get angry, so why should she continue to bother him?<br>
The system knew that Yu Qingshi’s route was a difficult one. Because it was Jiang Xiaoman’s system and not Yu Qingshi’s system, it could not interfere with his blackening process.<br>
Therefore, the system had no choice but to give up on Yu Qingshi’s route halfway and allow him to grow freely.<br>
The system wanted to focus on cultivating its own host instead.<br>
“Host, starting from today, I will tell you a bedtime story every day,” the system said. “You have to take every word I say to heart.”<br>
Was it going to tell her stories again?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked, “Stories about how the big systems bullied you?”<br>
“…”<br>
No. It was not Xianglin’s wife1; why would the system keep on talking about the same thing? It wanted to tell her the original scenario, the story about her miserable childhood, and how the fake daughter became happy by taking everything that belonged to Xiaoman.<br>
No one would be able to stay unaffected under such indoctrination.<br>
In the past, the host was too young and lived in a village without much contact with the outside world. The environment around her was too simple, and she wouldn’t understand if you spoke about evil to her.<br>
But it was different now. After coming to the city, Jiang Xiaoman now knew a good life and finally saw luxury and extravaganza. She was someone who had seen the world now. This way, she would see the gap between poverty and wealth, and it would be easy for her to blacken.<br>
Originally, it didn’t want to use such an extreme method. After all, the system had seen her grow up and had somewhat grown fond of her. If the system was too hard on her, it feared she wouldn’t be able to endure it.<br>
But now, the system felt that its host had grown too formidable and smart. The system didn’t need to be so reserved anymore and had to be a bit ruthless.<br>
The host’s mind was not as fragile as it thought. In fact, the system was the one that was in danger.<br>
That night, after she cleaned up for the day, Xiaoman cleverly sat on the bed while hugging a pillow, waiting for Brother System to tell her the story.<br>
“Once upon a time…” the system started. “There was a couple who had a cute little daughter. Their life was prosperous, and their family was harmonious. Many people gave their blessings when the daughter was born. They were a very enviable family of three.”<br>
“But it was a pity that fate had something else in store. Not long after the child was born, disaster struck2. The child was kidnapped!”<br>
“Ah!” Xiaoman exclaimed in surprise. “The little baby is so pitiful. Brother System, I don’t want to listen to stories like this. The little baby is so pitiful. Her Mom and Dad are so pitiful, too. Can you change it? I don’t want the baby to be kidnapped. Let the little baby stay with her Mom and Dad.”<br>
“……”<br>
It could not be changed.<br>
The system stubbornly said, “Host, don’t interrupt. Will you listen to the story? It has already been written and cannot be changed.”<br>
“Why? Isn’t it all just a made-up story? Since it’s all made-up, why do you have to follow the author?”<br>
“Because this is the ending that was written a long time ago.”<br>
“Just because it has been written, is it necessarily the correct one?”<br>
“…” The system didn’t know what to say, so it had to bluff and asked, “Do you want to listen or not?”<br>
Of course, she still wanted to listen.<br>
Xiaoman quickly stabilized her mood and obediently listened to the story.<br>

<p>Because She’s Pretty Cute (2)<br>
She had heard a lot of stories before, Cinderella, for example. The story looked miserable at first, but things would turn out okay later on.<br>
Maybe the little baby was just miserable at the start, but she would become happy later.<br>
Unfortunately, the story that the system was telling her today ended in tragedy.<br>
“At first, the baby was adopted by a family, and with much effort, managed to grow to four years old. Unfortunately, the uncle and grandmother who adopted the baby soon passed away because of an accident. No one wanted her, and all of her relatives passed her around. They thought that she was not a good child and did not want to raise her. She could only grow up by eating the food and wearing the clothes that the neighbors in the village3 donated.”<br>
“It’s very pitiful.” Jiang Xiaoman wiped her tears.<br>
The system continued, “She didn’t get to eat well ever since she was small. Her body did not have enough nutrition to grow well, and her brain was also not smart. She did want to go to school, but it was already amazing that she could even survive, so how could she go to school? She watched the students go to class with envy and wanted to listen in, but was driven away.”<br>
“Teacher Tang really is a good person,” Jiang Xiaoman said. “My mother was also almost kicked out.”<br>
“…” The system held back its anger and continued, “The baby finally grew up to fifteen and became a little girl. At that time, her parents finally found her and brought her home.”<br>
“It’s a good story.” Jiang Xiaoman wiped her eyes and cried, “The little baby is too miserable. Her parents must treat her well from now on and never beat or scold her. Let her wear nice clothes and go to school.”<br>
“Too naïve, you’re happy too early,” the system sneered, “Although her parents brought her back, there was already an adopted daughter at home. When the little baby could not eat until she’s full, her parents had to coax the adopted daughter, who was a picky eater. When the little baby did not have enough clothes to keep her warm, her parents prepared different clothes for the adopted daughter to wear every day. When the little baby could not go to school, her parents took the adopted daughter to summer camps on the other side of the world.”<br>
“Oh…” Jiang Xiaoman thought for a while. “Then you can just give the extra clothes, food, and summer camps to the little baby.”<br>
…Why was the host always focusing on the wrong thing?!<br>
The system couldn’t bear it anymore and told her straight, “Host, don’t you think that this story is very familiar? Isn’t the little baby very similar to you?”<br>
“Ah? Am I that miserable?” Jiang Xiaoman was shocked.<br>
“…originally, you were supposed to.” But since Jiang Xing was rescued and could return home, she was no longer so miserable.<br>
Whenever it remembered this, the system’s eyes moistened with tears of regret again.<br>
One wrong turn and everything went wrong.<br>
From then on, it lost the ability to control the situation, and sooner or later, it might even develop dementia.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman thought for a while but felt that the story was too miserable. It was not like her at all, so she didn’t think it was actually about her.<br>
After all, even though Grandma sometimes beat her and scold her, it was only occasionally and not often at all. Lately, Grandma had become really gentle, and Jiang Xiaoman was not afraid of her at all.<br>
But it did not stop her from thinking that it was a bad story.<br>
She told the system to change the ending; she didn’t like it.<br>
The system said that it wasn’t something that it could do. The story was written like this, and it was powerless to change it.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was so angry and yelled, “The person who wrote this story has something wrong in their head!”<br>
They actually treated the little baby like that! Too evil!<br>
The system said, “Host, I’m not trying to scare you. Think about it, you’re very miserable right now, but that fake daughter is very arrogant and spoiled. Everyone loves her and praises her. Your father and mother’s love are hers. Your life and everything that you should have is hers. Aren’t you angry thinking about it? Don’t you hate her?”<br>

<p>Because She’s Pretty Cute (3)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman wiped her eyes. After thinking about it, she felt that she really was too miserable.<br>
It was even worse than what Yu Qingshi had said.<br>
“I understand now.” Jiang Xiaoman cried and said, “Then I’m going to change my parents. I don’t want them anymore. I want Mama Jiang Yue as my mother. I’m still short a father. I’m going to find one myself.”<br>
“……”<br>
Aaaaahhh, I’m going to go crazy!!!<br>
The system did not give up and continued trying to enlighten her. Unfortunately, the result was unsatisfactory.<br>
System: bla bla bla.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman: aba aba aba.<br>
Communication failed.<br>
The system continued babbling until Jiang Xiaoman felt sleepy.<br>
“Tomorrow, Yu Qingshi is inviting me to the amusement park. I’m going to bed now. Let’s continue the story tomorrow. Good night, Brother System.”<br>
“… G-good night.” Life really wasn’t easy, and the system sighed.<br>
–<br>
The next day was the weekend, so Jiang Xiaoman didn’t have to go to school.<br>
Yu Qingshi invited Jiang Xiaoman to go to the amusement park.<br>
Actually, he didn’t like crowded places. Generally, during weekends and holidays, he usually stayed in his room by himself. He would play alone or play with Miaomiao. One person and one cat can stay inside the whole day.<br>
But there was no other way. His Dad said that Jiang Xiaoman had just come to the city and did not have any other friends. She must be very lonely, so he told him to spend more time playing with her.<br>
Yu Qingshi had no choice but to accompany her to play outside.<br>
Aiya, children were so troublesome.<br>
Especially Jiang Xiaoman; she was just trouble after trouble.<br>
But it was the kind of trouble that Yu Qingshi sought out himself.<br>
Because she was pretty cute, Yu Qingshi didn’t think she was too troublesome.<br>
Yu Qingshi woke up early and asked the driver to take him to Jiang Xiaoman’s house to pick her up.<br>
Xiaoman was still very sleepy. She had stayed up chatting with the system too long last night, so she was still in low spirits right now.<br>
She looked at the magnificent sedan and exclaimed, “Wow!”. After that, she felt a little motion sick. She tilted her head to look at Yu Qingshi and asked, “Can I sleep?”<br>
The amusement park was opened recently in the new town; it was a long way from here.<br>
Yu Qingshi estimated the distance for a while then nodded. “Yeah.”<br>
As soon as he said that, Jiang Xiaoman tilted her head and placed it directly on his lap, using it as a pillow.<br>
“…” Yu Qingshi frowned, feeling very uncomfortable.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was really troublesome.<br>
Ah, but forget it. Because she was cute, even when she fell asleep, he wouldn’t wake her up.<br>
Yu Qingshi felt that it was silent all the way to their destination.<br>
After around half an hour, they finally arrived at the amusement park.<br>
There were many people there on the weekends.<br>
Many parents brought their children out to play; it was very lively.<br>
Yu Qingshi was not used to it and wanted to turn around and leave, but Jiang Xiaoman was very excited. Her eyes dazzled, and she kept going “Wow!” again and again.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman had never come here before.<br>
Seeing that she had never been here before, he had to bear with it.<br>
Two adults followed them. Both of them were tall and buff bodyguards, but Yu Qingshi hated them, so he set a distance that they had to maintain. They could only watch him from ten meters away.<br>
The bodyguards… well, of course, they had no objections.<br>
Their young master’s situation was special, and he often had big ideas. They had to follow whatever he said.<br>
The driver queued in line to buy tickets. Yu Qingshi grabbed Xiaoman’s hand, fearing that she would get lost. The two children sat obediently on the bench by the road, waiting for the driver to return.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very curious and kept looking left and right. She wanted to play everything, and her head kept spinning around.<br>
When a young couple and a little girl dressed in pink entered her sight, the system that had been silent suddenly gave out warning alarms.<br>
【Target person found! Host, please go to confirm! 】<br>
【Target person found! Host, please go to confirm! 】<br>

<p>Just Hit Me Then (1)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman’s attention came back.<br>
She looked ahead and saw a crow of people, making it impossible to differentiate who was who.<br>
Which one was the target person?<br>
The last time Brother System became so enthusiastic was when Yu Qingshi appeared.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked for clarification a couple of times in her mind, but who knew what went wrong with the system? All it did was repeat the alert mechanically.<br>
【Target person found! Host, please go to confirm! 】<br>
【Target person found! Host, please go to confirm! 】<br>
【Target person found! Host, please go to confirm! 】<br>
Where should she go to confirm? Who was she supposed to look for?<br>
Since the system didn’t say anything, Xiaoman wouldn’t be able to recognize them anyway, so all she did was sit there motionlessly.<br>
Yu Qingshi didn’t know what she was thinking. Seeing her keep staring in one direction, he asked her, “Do you want to play with the trampoline?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“How about the bumper cars?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“The carousel?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
Well, there was nothing that she didn’t want to do.<br>
Soon he realized that his questions were pointless, so he quietly waited for the driver to return.<br>
At this moment, the system that had been stuck repeating the alert said something else. “Host!! Please quickly go to confirm the target person!” Its voice was shaking from anxiety.<br>
“Who’s the target person?”<br>
“The one from before. The couple with the little girl!” the system said, “They’re probably your biological parents!”<br>
“My Mom and Dad?” Jiang Xiaoman abruptly stood up, her face full of panic.<br>
Although she really wanted to change who her parents were, since they were already here, she should at least take a look.<br>
But…<br>
“Where are they?”<br>
“…” They were gone.<br>
Fuck.<br>
The system was so anxious that it used a swear word for the first time.<br>
When it got the target mission, it briefly broke down, perhaps because it was too excited.<br>
The system’s tears flowed silently in its heart. “Host, you… go look for them again. If you can find the mission’s target, the reward is 100 points.”<br>
100 points!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was instantly filled with energy. She immediately let go of Yu Qingshi’s hand and ran away at full speed, following the system’s instructions to the place where the couple last appeared.<br>
Find, find, find!<br>
Her eyes could not see anything else other than points right now.<br>
She didn’t notice Yu Qingshi, who was trying to catch up to her; his face was filled with anxiety.<br>
There were too many people there.<br>
There were many children on the weekends, and many of them were around Xiaoman’s age. She ran very fast and quickly disappeared like a fish jumping into the ocean. Soon, you wouldn’t be able to see her shadow.<br>
Yu Qingshi was afraid that she would get lost, so he ran after her.<br>
“Jiang Xiaoman! Come back!”<br>
He called her a few times, but Jiang Xiaoman didn’t respond at all. He started to get anxious and cry.<br>
After he cried for a while, the two bodyguards noticed that something was wrong and approached him.<br>
Yu Qingshi told them to find her with him.<br>
“Jiang Xiaoman is gone, waaah…” Yu Qingshi rarely cried, but for some reason, he couldn’t stop crying today.<br>
Why was she making others so anxious?<br>
He already told her not to run around, but she wouldn’t stay obedient. She needed to be spanked!<br>
【Ding dong! Make Yu Qingshi cry once. Bonus : +5 points]<br>
【Ding dong! Make Yu Qingshi cry twice. Bonus : +10 points]<br>
【Points arrived. Balance: -645】<br>
Jiang Xiaoman, who was concentrating on finding her parents, was taken aback. Hearing the system’s voice, she finally remembered about her little friend.<br>
That kid Yu Qingshi cried twice; wasn’t he unable to cry at all before? The system said that using Eucalyptus oil didn’t count as crying. He had to cry for real for it to count. This time, it looked he really was sad.<br>
She seemed to… have made Yu Qingshi get lost.<br>
This world was so cruel. What if he got abducted by bad guys?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman regretted it deeply and didn’t want to look for her parents anymore. She simply squatted at the roadside and cried while wiping her tears.</p>

<p>Just Hit Me Then (2)<br>
It was so big here, and there were so many people. She still wasn’t familiar with the place and couldn’t even remember from which direction she had come from!<br>
“Host, hold on a little longer—”<br>
“I don’t want to look for them anymore,” Jiang Xiaoman cried and said, “Yu Qingshi is lost. He won’t be able to see his father again in the future. He’ll be taken away by bad guys, and from then on, he won’t have enough food to eat nor enough clothes to keep him warm. He won’t be able to go to school anymore and will only survive on the food and clothes donated by the neighbors. His relatives will think he is troublesome and won’t want to take him in. He is so young, but he will have to starve, and no one will love him. When he finally manages to grow up to fifteen, he’ll finally be found again, but his parents will already have other children and don’t want him anymore. Waaaah… He’s so miserable, I’m going to go and. I’m him.”<br>
“……”<br>
The system once again felt that this is what it meant to ‘shoot oneself in the foot.’<br>
Why did it tell her that story? Now she didn’t want to work anymore!<br>
The system was furious.<br>
The system said, “Host, calm down. You didn’t lose him, and he has two bodyguards with him. Nothing will go wrong. You’re worrying for nothing.”<br>
“Really? I don’t believe it.”<br>
There was nothing else the system could do.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman hadn’t believed it at first, but she soon did.<br>
Yu Qingshi came with the two bodyguards and found her.<br>
When he found her, she was still squatting at the roadside while wiping her eyes and crying miserably.<br>
The weight in his heart finally lifted, and Yu Qingshi breathed a sigh of relief. After he gathered his thoughts, he became angry again.<br>
How could she still dare to cry? Wasn’t she the one who ran away by herself?<br>
Fortunately, she didn’t meet a bad person. If she did, it would be useless to cry now.<br>
The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. And the angrier he got, the more he wanted to cry. Yu Qingshi was so angry that he started crying and sobbing.<br>
He rushed to her angrily, saying, “Jiang Xiaoman! Just why did you run off!?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was a little absent-minded. She held his hands and cried, “I’m sorry I lost you, waaah… Luckily you didn’t meet any bad people, or I wouldn’t be able to explain to Uncle Yu. No matter where you go in the future, you have to hold my hand, understand? Don’t you know that the world is so cruel that I don’t even dare to run away from home? There are bad people that specialize in bullying children, especially the ones like you.”<br>
Who was the one who lost whom!?!?<br>
Did she think that it was his fault?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman, you really deserve to be spanked!<br>
Yu Qingshi was furious and finally couldn’t hold back anymore. He spanked her ass hard to give her a lesson.<br>
Then the two children cried together.<br>
【Ding dong! Make Yu Qingshi cry thrice. Bonus : +15 points]<br>
【Points arrived. Balance: -630】<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very sad at first, but when she heard the sound of the points coming, she felt that it was actually quite all right.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said while crying, “Go one, keep on hitting me. When you hit me, your heart hurts, so you will cry more. It’s okay. I’m not afraid of the pain at all.”<br>
Yu Qingshi was really angry.<br>
He suddenly felt that he was Jiang Xiumei’s kindred spirit. At this moment, he finally understood why Jiang Xiaoman’s grandma liked to spank people so much.<br>
He didn’t cry anymore and only hit her ass angrily.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman saw that he wasn’t giving out points anymore and didn’t let him spank her anymore.<br>
The two kids looked away from each other and sulked, ignoring the other.<br>
After a while, the driver, who had been queueing in line to buy tickets, returned with two tickets for the carousel.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know via our discord so we can fix it as soon as possible.</p>


<p>Just Hit Me Then (3)<br>
Just that by that time, the two children did not want to play anymore. They both felt that the other one couldn’t tell what was good from bad and that everything was the other’s fault. The other party had to apologize first before talking to them again, and they were unwilling to go hand-in-hand to the carousel.<br>
Because the tickets had been bought, so it wasn’t good to waste them.<br>
Finally, the bodyguards went hand-in-hand to ride the carousel.<br>
After they were done, everyone went back.<br>
Yu Qingshi sent Jiang Xiaoman home. When they reached the door, he fiercely ‘hmph!’-ed at her and coldly said, “I’m never going out to play with you again.”<br>
He really had been blind to think that she was cute.<br>
She was horrible!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was nastier than him and retorted with her hands akimbo, “Hmph! I’m not willing to go even if you beg me to.”<br>
The two talked harshly to each other, then went back to their own home.<br>
What a bad day.<br>
–<br>
When she returned home, the tear marks on her face had not faded yet. Her face was white and tender, so her red eyes looked particularly miserable.<br>
Jiang Xiumei, who saw it, hugged her precious granddaughter and asked her a few times if she had a fight with Yu Qingshi.<br>
Did she win?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman hmph-ed angrily. When Grandma asked her, she started feeling wronged again. She cried and said, “I lost him, but I was still worried about him. I didn’t even look for my parents for his sake, but he actually hit me…”<br>
Jiang Xiumei became unhappy.<br>
That kid Yu Qingshi usually behaved well, so why was he suddenly acting so unreasonable?<br>
Jiang Xiumei asked her, “Why were you looking for your parents?”<br>
“Just… I’m just looking for those terrible, terrible parents. Anyways, it doesn’t matter.” She said, “He also brought two uncles with him. The system was right. I was worrying for nothing. Even if I lost him, he wouldn’t lose his way. But he still scolded me for running away and being disobedient, even hitting me. Waaah…”<br>
Jiang Xiumei went silent.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman continued, “Even after he hit me and scold me, I was still generous and told him to hit me more. But he became very angry and said that he didn’t want to play with me anymore.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei took a deep breath. “I see. That kid is usually pretty good, so the reason he started hitting others…”<br>
Was because Jiang Xiaoman was totally asking for it.<br>
This child was really capable of pushing someone’s buttons.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had nothing else to say. She reprimanded her for a bit, saying that everyone was still good friends, don’t fight with each other.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was so angry that she didn’t want to speak to Grandma.<br>
In the evening, Jiang Xing came home with a frown.<br>
The uncle and niece pair sat in the yard and sighed together.<br>
Jiang Xing asked her, “Why are you sighing?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman also asked him, “Why are you sighing?”<br>
Jiang Xing said, “Xiaoman. I, your uncle, have met an enemy.”<br>
“Huh?” Jiang Xiaoman immediately said seriously. “Uncle, didn’t Grandma tell you to stop doing bad things? If you get in a fight again, I’m going to tell Grandma!”<br>
“What fight? We’re all gentlemen. We don’t get into those kinds of fights,” Jiang Xing said weakly. “I, your Uncle, had his business snatched by someone.”<br>
The more he spoke, the angrier he got. He had been keeping it inside with no outlet to vent, so he held her in his arms and poured his heart out. Blah blah blah, his bitterness poured out like water.<br>
“I have arranged my logistic lines well and operated at a loss first to establish a customer base. Who would’ve expected that just as it was about to start bearing fruit, it was eyed by someone else? I’ve talked to so many people and went so many times, but it was snatched by a paratrooper at the end! Damn it. I’m so angry!”<br>
“What’s a paratrooper?” Jiang Xiaoman asked him.<br>
“The ones whose legs easily break,” Jiang Xing coldly laughed. “Xiaoman, just wait and see. I, your uncle, am not going to give in so easily!!”<br>
His enemy was a pretty boy who relied on his in-laws and had now come back to his old hometown to cause trouble. Jiang Xing had already asked around clearly and found out the other party’s background.</p>

<p>I Want to Eat Meat (1)<br>
Jiang Xing’s business was still in the development stage. He had spent a lot of money to attract customers; at most, he was just breaking even.<br>
But Jiang Xing was not worried about losing some money in this initial stage. Once the net was cast, turning a profit and getting his investment back would only take a blink of an eye.<br>
But darn! This paratrooper pretty boy was just as wise as him, and had the same long-term vision!<br>
Jiang Xing had spent a lot of money to build his customer base, and that pretty boy just came and sat back while burning money to grab his customers!<br>
The key issue was that the other party still had a lot of money! They were unfazed even after burning that much money.<br>
But Jiang Xing’s reserves weren’t as deep, and he almost died from anger.<br>
After he tried asking around, he found out that this crazy boy didn’t mind burning money because it wasn’t his own, so it didn’t hurt him to spend it.<br>
The money belonged to his in-laws.<br>
The pretty boy was a local whose ancestors came from here, but he got a rich wife and moved away with his whole family.<br>
He came back this time to do big business, and planned on facing Jiang Xing head-on.<br>
Jiang Xing was so angry that he had no appetite for dinner, and took a walk in the yard instead.<br>
It was impossible to compete at burning money, and it was too late to find a rich wife to take care of him.<br>
He could only try a different approach.<br>
Hmph, it’s time to let this brat know that even a mighty dragon cannot defeat a local snake!<br>
Did he live as a jerk all this time for nothing?<br>
Jiang Xing angrily rushed out of the door.<br>
The young and old at home were very worried, but it was a bit awkward to ask. Even if they had asked, they wouldn’t be able to understand, so all they could do was stay quiet and not cause him any trouble.<br>
Around three to four days later, Jiang Xing finally came home.<br>
His eyes and nose were red, and when he came back, he immediately took a hot water bath. When he came out, his beaming face was full of energy.<br>
It seemed that he was in a good mood, but his face looked like he had just cried.<br>
Jiang Xiumei was stunned.<br>
This brat had been a jerk ever since he was young, and got beaten all the time. But he rarely shed any tears.<br>
If he actually cried this time, who knew how wronged he felt?<br>
“Xingxing, did you solve the problem or not?” She asked.<br>
“Mom, don’t worry. As soon as I take matters into my own hands, everything will be a cinch.” He looked like a different person from the guy who was furious the other day.<br>
Jiang Xing was very happy.<br>
He said, “If you want to snatch, then go ahead. Small-time businessmen are very shrewd. Whatever amount of money you burn is going to be your loss. I’ve already thought about this. I’ll let the middlemen get the profit from the price difference and get the goods straight from the customers. This is the most realistic solution.”<br>
“What’s a middleman?”<br>
“The company has now reached the residential districts1. This way, customers can go and send stuff when they come down the building. It’s convenient for thousands of households; they won’t even have to leave their home.”<br>
“Huh? The company can operate directly inside the residential districts? The residential districts in this town?”<br>
“That’s right.” Jiang Xing smiled mysteriously. “I went to the mayor’s office and cried, saying that I would jump off the building if he wouldn’t agree to let me open the company in the residential districts. He had no choice but to agree.”<br>
“Huh???” What kind of business is this? This kind of thing also works? Wouldn’t that make it messy instead?<br>
Jiang Xiumei was stunned.<br>
“Just kidding.” Jiang Xing said. “I just went there carrying the ‘Bravely Upholding Justice’ banner and told him that I needed some help since I encountered some difficulties when starting my business.”<br>
“……”<br>
“This thing is still pretty useful huh.” Jiang Xiumei said.<br>
Well, that’s the way it was. He didn’t even care about losing his face at all.<br>
An adult, crying until snot and tears flowed down.<br>
But Jiang Xing didn’t care.<br>
He patted his chest and said, “I got stabbed in my stomach and got entered into the records. How could it be for nothing?”<br>
Well, whatever the reason was, things were finally done.<br>
He wanted to open a new business, but he had to keep spending money to develop it.</p>

<p>I Want to Eat Meat (2)<br>
He didn’t have that much capital, so he could only crack open his savings to open up new strongholds and recruit more people.<br>
Before he could roll it out in full gear, he first needed to find a high-quality residential district to test the waters.<br>
So far, everything was fine, but in one night, his finances went back to the pre-Liberation era.<br>
The family had to start living frugally.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had nothing to say.<br>
She had lived for a long time, and she understood just by seeing it.<br>
There were still a few acres of fertile land back in the village, as well as their ancestral house. If they really could not live here anymore, she could just return to the village to work the farm, grow vegetables, and raise pigs.<br>
They could survive any kind of life.<br>
She was used to living a hard life, and there was nothing she couldn’t let go of.<br>
But this expensive, horribly dilapidated house must not be sold.<br>
Xiaoman still needed to go to school.<br>
The educational resources in the city were very good. Jiang Xiumei was not willing to let Xiaoman return and study in the village.<br>
Although there was Teacher Tang in the village, it wasn’t enough overall. Even though the children could go study somewhere else after the third grade, how many of them really went?<br>
With the difference in the level of their foundation, they would struggle to keep up with the pace. It would take a lot of hardship and hard work to make up for it.<br>
Since the house was already available, they could still pay the tuition fee while gritting their teeth. Even if they couldn’t, she could go and find a job as a janitor in a school or shopping center, just like back in the village.<br>
This old lady was not afraid of hardships or showing effort; she could always make a little money for her children. As long as she was diligent, she could create some wealth with her pair of hands.<br>
Although in her opinion, ever since she came to the kindergarten in the city, Jiang Xiaoman didn’t do anything serious every day. There was no homeworks or exams. It was unlike with Teacher Tang, who always taught truth and culture. However, Xiaoman’s mind seemed to develop really fast.<br>
It was so fast that Jiang Xiumei couldn’t keep up with the speed of her enlightenment. When she acted too smart, sometimes she ended up making people really angry. Jiang Xiumei often could not beat her in an argument.<br>
Jiang Xiumei arranged everything properly, and let Jiang Xing do his thing without interference.<br>
To prepare for Jiang Xing’s bankruptcy, Jiang Xiumei also planned to train Jiang Xiaoman to get used to enduring hardships. For several days, all they ate were vegetable dishes, without even a shred of meat.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman really liked to eat meat. She looked at the green soup and asked, “Grandma, how come all that we eat are vegetables, and there isn’t even any oil in it?”<br>
Poor child. Jiang Xiumei said patiently, “Life is no longer as easy as it was. Xiaoman, follow Grandma to endure hardships for a while, so we can save money for your uncle. This is a critical point where he lacks money; we can’t be holding him back.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was a good kid.<br>
She had followed Jiang Xiumei since she was small and was not afraid of suffering. Although she was rebellious and naughty now, she was still sensible when things got serious.<br>
After hearing that, she took out her private savings and gave them to Grandma.<br>
All her New Year’s money was kept there, a bunch of red envelopes containing a few cents each. All in all, they didn’t add up to more than ten yuan.<br>
Normally, Jiang Xiaoman really treasured her money. She usually took them to the canteen to buy some sweets, or used them to call her uncle.<br>
Two cents could be used to call for one minute. She would look at the screen closely and hang up as soon as the time was up, not wasting even a little. If she exceeded the time, she would be charged another two cents.<br>
But now, she planned to give them all away.<br>
Jiang Xiumei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She didn’t take Jiang Xiaoman’s money, letting her keep it instead.<br>
When she thought about it, it seemed that her education in enduring hardships was already enough. She planned to let her eat some meat tonight and have a nice dinner.<br>
Who would’ve known that when Jiang Xiaoman went to school, she immediately fell flat on the table and cried bitterly.<br>
When she thought about how there would be no more meat to eat in the future, she felt very miserable.</p>

<p>I Want to Eat Meat (3)<br>
Originally, she thought that the most painful thing in this world was to have no candy. But now, she knew that not having any sweets or snacks was not the most painful thing; it was not having any meat to eat, only vegetables.<br>
It turned out that she was so miserable!<br>
The more she cried, the more she couldn’t hold back until Yu Qingshi finally approached her.<br>
Originally, Yu Qingshi was still angry and didn’t plan to pay her any attention. The two were still engulfed in a cold war. But she was crying so pitifully, he couldn’t bear seeing it.<br>
“Why are you crying?”<br>
Xiaoman wiped her tears, sobbing, “Grandma said that our family is going bankrupt; we have no more money. From now on, we can only eat vegetables, we can’t eat meat anymore. It’s painful to think of eating vegetables every day. I’m not a worm, why do I have to eat greens every day? If I eat greens every day, I might eventually turn into a butterfly and fly away. If I flew away, I wouldn’t be able to come to school again, I won’t be able to see Grandma and Uncle again. I’m going to eat greens everyday and become a worm.”<br>
Yu Qingshi’s complexion changed, and he felt goose bumps all over his body.<br>
In his dictionary, there was no such thing as not being able to eat meat. His Dad only had him eat some vegetables for nutritional balance.<br>
If he was picky and wouldn’t eat them, then his Dad’s face would become gloomy.<br>
He used to think that his father was too fierce and he was miserable, but after hearing her words, he felt that he was actually living a happy life.<br>
At least there was meat to eat, and he did not have to eat vegetables every day.<br>
Thinking this way, he really was different from her.<br>
She was just too pitiful.<br>
“I’ll treat you to some beef noodles, okay?”<br>
“That won’t do. Then, I wouldn’t be enduring hardships anymore.” Jiang Xiaoman still remembered their cold war and said resolutely, “Moreover, I already said that I will not eat your food again.”<br>
Grandma said that a child could be greedy for anything, but not food. Otherwise, it would be easy to get abducted because of a piece of candy. Jiang Xiaoman still remembered her words.<br>
However, she also wanted to eat meat.<br>
Yu Qingshi silently thought for a moment, then said, “Then… consider it me begging you. I’ll treat you to beef noodles, in return you can come to my house to help me with my homework, okay?”<br>
“Can’t you do it by yourself?<br>
“…there’s too much to do.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman stopped crying. She thought for a while and thought that this was fine.<br>
That Yu Qingshi really did not know how to cherish things. He had homework to do but he didn’t like to do it. Back then, she wanted to do homework but did not have a book to write it on. She really liked to do homework.<br>
“Okay.”<br>
The two reached an agreement, and under the temptation of beef noodles, the cold war stopped.<br>
After school, Yu Qingshi took Jiang Xiaoman to eat beef noodles.<br>
This beef noodle restaurant was a well-known brand that had existed for a long time. He had eaten here before; their beef noodles were very fragrant and delicious.<br>
Because it was too fragrant, she was a bit unable to control her tears and saliva.<br>
She thought that this might be the last time she could eat meat in her life, so she cherished it very much. She wanted to eat more. In the future, she wouldn’t have enough money to eat it again.<br>
The owner was busy manning the outlet. Jiang Xiaoman was brave, and knew that if children cried, they would be given candy. She started shedding tears as soon as she spoke.<br>
She said, “Uncle Boss, can I have just a bowl of beef without the noodles?”<br>
Actually, she wasn’t the only one who thought that. A lot of people in the store thought the same, but only she dared to say it.<br>
The owner felt a bit awkward.<br>
Since she was cute, he added a piece of beef for her.<br>
Xiaoman was so touched that she cried miserably, “Thank you, Boss. Wuu wuu wuu…”<br>
She cried so miserably that the boss almost wanted to give her another piece of meat.<br>
Yu Qingshi couldn’t bear seeing her anymore and put all the beef in his bowl to hers. “I’ll give them all to you, eat them quickly.”<br>
“Are you not eating?” Xiaoman was very moved, but also felt a little bad for him.<br>
“… I’m full just looking at you eating.” He said.<br>
How long had she not eaten meat? She was really pitiful.<br>
She almost turned stupid from hunger.</p>

<p>Meow, Meow, Meow (1)<br>
Yu Qingshi’s house was very large, but there were very few people there.<br>
His grandparents had their own house and didn’t live with them; usually, it was only him and his father. However, Yu Wencheng was also a very busy person. Although he tried his best to spend more time with his son, most of the time, the house was deserted with no one there.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman’s arrival made things different.<br>
“Wow! It’s so beautiful here!” She exclaimed when she saw the small flower garden.<br>
“Wow! This is great!” She said when she saw the dividing screen at the entrance.<br>
“Wow!! There are little goldfish here!!” Was what she said when she saw the rockery in the flower garden.<br>
In reality, this was not the first time she saw all of this, but she always praised them exaggeratedly every time. Yu Qingshi suspected that she was doing this deliberately, but it felt a bit awkward for him to ask.<br>
Today, Yu Wencheng was also not at home. Only he, the little master, was around. The other day, he had invited Xiaoman to eat beef noodles. She still remembered that she had to help him with his homework in return.<br>
Yu Qingshi fell into deep thought. Although he was used to being alone, it seemed like a good idea to have someone to accompany him and chat on weekends once in a while, so he invited Jiang Xiaoman to come and help him do his homework.<br>
“Meow meow meow?” Jiang Xiaoman’s head looked left and right as if looking for something.<br>
A short while later, Miaomiao walked out.<br>
Usually, it slept a lot and nobody could disturb it. Only Yu Qingshi, his little master, could approach it and give it a scratch.<br>
Yu Qingshi had always thought that this was his privilege as its master. After all, Miaomiao would ignore even his Dad. But Jiang Xiaoman… she could scratch it too.<br>
She meowed a few times as if she could talk to Miaomiao. She meowed and it would meow back. The two meowed back and forth happily.<br>
This made Yu Qingshi feel jealous after a while, and his heart felt uncomfortable.<br>
She could enter his bedroom, scratch his cat, and even eat his snacks.<br>
It was like there was nothing she couldn’t do.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s heart began to turn green from jealousy again. Seeing her meow, he didn’t know what to think and followed as well in his milky voice, “Meow.”<br>
If he didn’t meow too, perhaps Xiaoman would be the only one in Miaomiao’s eyes.<br>
Xiaoman glanced at him surprised, “Meow meow?”<br>
Yu Qingshi: “Meow meow meow!”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman: “Meow meow meow meow?!”<br>
“…meow~!” This one was made by Miaomiao, who interrupted the conversation between the two little idiots.<br>
It squinted its eyes, enjoying Xiaoman’s scratches. It grunted a few times, as if saying “Why are you going meow meow meow instead of using the beautiful human language?”<br>
The two children stopped talking.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman asked him, “Why are you meowing?”<br>
“Why are you meowing?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman made a pig nose gesture and triumphantly said, “Not only can I meow, I can also oink!”<br>
That was how Big Flower and Little Flower sounded.<br>
“…” Yu Qingshi ignored the topic and didn’t oink with her. He took out some canned cat food, planning to feed Miaomiao.<br>
This was a canned whole meat that he just bought. It smelled very good.<br>
That ungrateful Miaomiao. As soon as he smelled it, he left Jiang Xiaoman and went into Yu Qingshi’s arms.<br>
Only then did Yu Qingshi feel happy, his heart no longer upset.<br>
Who would’ve known that Jiang Xiaoman would stare at the canned food in his hand with bright eyes, asking pitifully, “Can I have a bite?”<br>
“……”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was starving.<br>
She even wanted to snatch Miaomiao’s food!<br>
He felt that she was too pitiful, and was no longer jealous that she had won Miaomiao’s affection.<br>
“Let’s go eat first.” He said, “My maid learned to make beef jerky recently. It’s delicious.”<br>
When he couldn’t finish eating them, he usually kept them to snack on later.<br>
It used no additives and could not be kept for too long, but the taste and quality of ingredients were better than the snacks that were sold at markets.<br>
He was already planning to bring them to school to share with Xiaoman, but since she was here already, they could just eat them together.<br>
Xiaoman couldn’t help covering her mouth and grinning when she learned that she would have something to eat. But after grinning for a while, her mouth flattened again, and her mood became gloomy.<br>
Her conscience felt bad.<br>
Grandma said that children must not be gluttonous, and they must not take things from strangers. The system also told her about soft mouth, short hands. She was always eating Yu Qingshi’s food – would she have short hands in the future?</p>
<p style="font-size:15px;">If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let us know via our discord so we can fix it as soon as possible.</p>


<p>Meow, Meow, Meow (2)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman looked down and saw her small, chubby hands. She comforted herself in a small voice, “Even if my hands are short, I’m still very cute.”<br>
“What did you say?” Yu Qingshi didn’t hear her clearly.<br>
“No… I mean, you are very cute.” Jiang Xiaoman avoided his gaze with a guilty conscience.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s face blushed and he was a bit embarrassed.<br>
–<br>
After feeding Miaomiao until it was full, the two children went to eat beef jerky.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s taste was rather light. The beef jerky contained chili, so just one piece was already spicy enough to the point where he couldn’t eat anymore. It was greasy and he felt nauseous, wanting to vomit.<br>
His eyes had tears in them, but he saw Xiaoman eating so happily and felt bad about wasting his food.<br>
She was almost out of food, but he had beef jerky to eat and even thought that it was not good.<br>
After thinking for a while, he ran to the kitchen and brought a piece of lettuce back.<br>
Nom nom nom, he put it inside his mouth.<br>
Nutritional balance.<br>
“…” Jiang Xiaoman was taken aback.<br>
She was stunned.<br>
She didn’t know what Yu Qingshi meant to do.<br>
He could actually eat green vegetables raw. He was so amazing!<br>
She took time out of her busy schedule (of eating jerky) to clap her hands, exclaiming, “You are amazing!”<br>
Yu Qingshi was swallowing in tears, and sincerely replied, “You are also amazing!”<br>
“No, no.” Jiang Xiaoman did not know the immensity of heaven and earth. This was the first time she was being humble, because she had not eaten green vegetables raw. “You are the more amazing one.”<br>
So, the two began complimenting each other to the moon and back.<br>
The atmosphere became happy and harmonious, and the two almost forgot that they had ever quarreled.<br>
Yu Qingshi took a few more pieces of lettuce, wanting to invite her to eat some. But Xiaoman would now become sick when she saw green vegetables, and wouldn’t eat them anymore at all. There was no helping it. He couldn’t finish them all alone, so he could only secretly give them to Miaomiao.<br>
Anything that could be eaten, and even things that could not be eaten, Miaomiao would eat them all. As long as it wanted to, it could figure out a way to eat them.<br>
It would eat plastic bags and even flip through the trash can. There was nothing that it couldn’t eat.<br>
Miaomiao had good teeth and ate even better than Yu Qingshi. Soon, all of them were finished.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman exclaimed, “The cat takes after the owner. Miaomiao is so amazing!”<br>
Miaomiao meowed in reply, then curled down to sleep.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman still wanted to eat more beef jerky, but Yu Qingshi wouldn’t let her. He remembered his maid saying that childrens’ digestion wasn’t very good. It was still okay to eat beef jerky as a snack, but if they ate too much, they would have a stomachache.<br>
Since he didn’t let her eat, she had no choice but to comply. The beef jerky was really delicious. She had never eaten anything that tasted like it, so she decided to ask Yu Qingshi’s maid how to make this beef jerky. She would memorize it first now, so that once she became rich, she would be able to make them and eat them at home.<br>
But after learning that a catty of beef actually cost more than ten yuan, Jiang Xiaoman gave up on this idea.<br>
All of her personal funds were not enough for a single catty of beef.<br>
Wuu wuu wuu, it was too expensive. She felt that all the money she had saved from two New Years might not even amount to that much. She felt very sad.<br>
After they had enough to eat and drink, it was finally time to get down to business and do homework.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s bedroom was very large. It was divided into two separate spaces, the study and the living room.<br>
His desk was very big – it wasn’t a problem for two children to do their homework on it at the same time. Of course, kindergarten children did not have a lot of homework in the first place. But the two of them were very self-disciplined. The homework that the teacher gave them had long been done, the rest of it was just playing.<br>
Yu Qingshi did more homework than other children. Jiang Xiaoman had already known about his exercise books.<br>
He was usually a quiet person, and liked to write and draw when he was alone. His family made every effort to help cultivate his hobbies. They bought him drawing books and exercise books, and let him do them.<br>
Basically, any exercise book that existed in the city could also be found in Yu Qingshi’s house.<br>
Some were reading materials chosen by the psychiatrist. Some of them were books that Yu Wencheng bought. Some were bought by his grandparents and others were the ones that the teacher told them to buy.<br>
In the beginning, Yu Qingshi had no particular opinion about it. He didn’t like playing with other children, not finding it fun. All they did was cry. It was better to do homework than play in the mud with them. But gradually, he became a bit unhappy.<br>
Because there were just too many exercise books.<br>
He couldn’t finish doing all of them.</p>

<p>Meow, Meow, Meow (3)<br>
He took out a few exercise books as well as drawing books from the shelf. “Here, these are for you. If you like them, take them home with you.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman liked the drawing book very much. The white paper made people want to scribble on it very much, but she was reluctant to do it.<br>
Because her drawings were so ugly.<br>
All of her drawings look like tadpoles or ghostly scratch marks.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very prideful, but she was self-aware of this weakness.<br>
“If I take them, where would you write?”<br>
Yu Qingshi pointed at the row of books behind him. “I still have… a lot.”<br>
“Wow!” Jiang Xiaoman exclaimed in surprise, then accepted them in peace. She thanked him, “Thank you, Yu Qingshi. You really are a good person. You sent me exercise books before, but I already gave them to Teacher Tang.”<br>
It was a beautiful accident.<br>
Yu Qingshi blushed with shame.<br>
He originally didn’t give them with good intentions. He only wanted to let her know how amazing he was; he didn’t expect that she would become so happy.<br>
Yu Qingshi was embarrassed inside, and he said in a small voice, “If you like them, then that’s good.”<br>
Eh, there was no way around it. She was so pitiful and miserable, but still so strong and optimistic. His Dad was right; he had to study from and be grateful to her more. Yu Qingshi felt that the world had become more wonderful and interesting.<br>
Please treat her better in the future.<br>
This child was so pitiful.<br>
The two children played together until they forgot the time. Only when the evening came did Jiang Xiaoman remember to go home.<br>
At that time, Yu Wencheng arrived home. When he saw her, he asked her to stay for dinner and told her to leave after eating.<br>
He had already asked the maid, and learnt that his son and Xiaoman had been playing for a long time. He felt really moved.<br>
She was the only one who could coax his son, play with him peacefully and cure his picky eating problems. Yu Wencheng really wanted to treat her like a little ancestor.<br>
It would be great if he could keep her here; there was no need for her to go home.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman also wanted to stay, but she felt very guilty.<br>
She had already eaten Yu Qingshi’s beef jerky. If she also had dinner there, what would Grandma do to her when she got home?<br>
“Uncle Yu, I have already eaten beef jerky…” She hesitated, saying, “I can’t eat any more food. Grandma will scold me.”<br>
“Oh, it’s okay.” Yu Wencheng said. “We’ll pack some to bring home for your Grandma just like last time, okay?”<br>
“Eh? No, no, no can do.” Jiang Xiaoman waved her hands in a hurry.<br>
She ate good food here; she was already no longer enduring hardships. If Grandma knew that she had eaten meat, she would definitely scold her! And she ate all of it alone, she also felt very sorry for Grandma.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said in a low voice, “Grandma said that we have to endure hardships now. We cannot eat meat, only vegetables. We have only eaten vegetables without any oil for the past few days at home. Uncle Yu is sure to make me bring a lot of delicious food home. Then that wouldn’t be enduring hardships anymore.”<br>
The more she spoke, the softer her voice became.<br>
She now felt very guilty for breaking the prohibition.<br>
Yu Wencheng did not know, and was afraid that Xiaoman’s family had a particular ritual. To make sure he would not break someone else’s rule, he carefully asked, “What rituals does your Grandma do? Do you have to fast and cleanse yourself?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman shook her head, “No, we’re just going bankrupt.”<br>
“??” Yu Wencheng was dazed again.<br>
Very often, he would be caught off guard when talking to Jiang Xiaoman and could not follow what she was thinking.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried and said, “I don’t understand either. In short, Grandma said that Uncle is at a critical juncture and is short on money. Our family will go bankrupt and have no money to eat meat. She told me to learn to endure hardships, so we can still survive through the hard times.”<br>
“……”<br>
Yu Wencheng was suspicious. Did something big happen to the Jiang family that he did not notice?<br>
But he still saw Jiang Xing today, and it didn’t seem like he was going to go bankrupt. Had life in his family already become so miserable?<br>
Yu Wencheng calmly asked, and only then did he understand the whole story.<br>
He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He rubbed Xiaoman’s head and said, “I understand. I’ll find a chance to talk to your uncle.”</p>

<p>Your Grandma Loves Me Too Much (1)<br>
When Jiang Xiaoman returned home, she was carrying bags of food on both her hands.<br>
They were all full of meat.<br>
There was the beef jerky that Yu Qingshi gave her, and the food that Yu Wencheng had packed for her. The bags were filled to the brim.<br>
It was not that she was greedy, but Yu Wencheng was too enthusiastic and stuffed her with so much without saying a word. Only after stuffing her with food did he have someone send her home.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had been eagerly waiting for her to come home. She had prepared a table of feast, with braised pork shoulders, steamed pork with dried vegetables and a lot of other meat dishes, all of which were usually only eaten during celebrations.<br>
She was afraid that Xiaoman had abstained from eating meat for too long, so she prepared these with special effort.<br>
Who would’ve known that when that little fella came back, she brought even more dishes than Jiang Xiumei had prepared.<br>
Her complexion instantly became gloomy.<br>
“Jiang Xiaoman!” She raised her voice, asking. “How have I been teaching you? Are you going to your good friend’s house to eat his food?”<br>
This bad habit was unacceptable.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s family was not simple. It was what you would call a major family back in the days.<br>
But you couldn’t always go to his house to get stuff just because he was kind and approachable. Then what difference would it make between her and someone who was just looking for benefits?<br>
There was a big gap between their families. Children don’t overthink things; the two could be good friends because their minds were pure and simple, but people who liked to gossip might be saying ugly things.<br>
Jiang Xiumei didn’t want Xiaoman to climb any high branches. When the children played together and got along well, she did not have any ulterior motive. Her conscience was clear.<br>
But if other people knew about this kind of behavior such as “taking advantage” of their family’s kindness, they might say something bad about Xiaoman.<br>
Xiaoman was stunned for a bit, then she said in a low voice, “Grandma, don’t be angry. Uncle Yu actually wanted to give me even more, I already put back a lot secretly. I didn’t want it either, but Grandma hadn’t eaten any meat for days…”<br>
Although she ate good food outside, she hadn’t forgotten about her Grandma. She was such a good girl, even Uncle Yu praised her!<br>
Jiang Xiumei’s complexion eased a lot, but she still put on a long face and did not speak for a long time.<br>
Xiaoman flattened her mouth, feeling a bit wronged. But she knew that Grandma would become angry, so she had already thought of ways to explain herself on the way back. When she spoke, her voice sounded a bit like she was on the verge of tears.<br>
“Uncle Yu said that children who do not eat meat will not get enough nutrients. Their body will not grow bigger and their brain will not get enough nutrients to develop. They will not grow to be beautiful or smart. Uncle Yu also said that if the elderly do not eat meat, they will not get enough energy and would suffer from osteoporosis, and their eyes would dim. By not eating meat, they save a small amount of money but end up with serious health issues in the long term. It would be putting the cart before the horse. That is not a good thing.”<br>
“…” Jiang Xiumei didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She stared at her, “You really can talk, huh.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was afraid that she would start beating her again, and continued loudly, “Wuu wuu wuu. Grandma, I’ll only eat it just this once, alright? I won’t dare to anymore. I won’t find Yu Qingshi to play anymore.”<br>
She shed her tears while still holding the bags of food tightly in her hands.<br>
The bags were heavy and left red marks on her hands, but she still wouldn’t let them go. She gave them to Jiang Xiumei while crying with much effort.<br>
She looked really pitiful. So pitiful that it made Jiang Xiumei look like the bad guy.<br>
After a while, she sighed and took the bags in her hands.<br>
Seeing the red marks on her hand, Jiang Xiumei felt bad. She blew on Xiaoman’s hands and wiped her tears, saying quietly, “Xiaoman, Grandma is not prohibiting you from associating with Yu Qingshi, but you need to know the boundaries.”<br>
It wasn’t clear if Jiang Xiaoman really understood or not; all she did was nod.<br>
Jiang Xiumei continued, “Uncle Yu helped your Uncle a lot, and in return your Uncle also helped him. This way, the relationship between our families can last. Now that we have taken things from their family, we also have to give them something back. It’s not important if they’re not expensive, as long as the intent is delivered.”<br>
This time, Jiang Xiaoman looked like she finally understood. She asked in a low voice, “Like with Teacher Tang?”<br>
“Correct.”<br>
They give Teacher Tang gifts on New Year’s. Did she have to give Yu Qingshi a gift on New Year’s too?<br>
But Yu Qingshi was not her mentor.</p>

<p>Your Grandma Loves Me Too Much (2)<br>
Jiang Xiaoman frowned; she couldn’t figure out the web of relationships.<br>
Well, it’s fine if she didn’t. All she had to do for now was to be obedient. After all, adults always had these strange and weird rules. Children weren’t as troublesome.<br>
She was more concerned about something else.<br>
“Yu Qingshi and I planned to do his homework at his home next weekend, can I still go?” She was afraid that Grandma wouldn’t let her.<br>
“Yes, it’s fine.”<br>
Jiang Xiumei gave her permission, and Jiang Xiaoman cheered happily.<br>
As for the rest, that was not something she needed to worry about, as long as she was happy.<br>
–<br>
At night, when she was about to sleep, she hugged the pillow as usual and waited for Brother System to tell her a story. But after waiting for a long time, the system still was not saying anything.<br>
It was abnormally silent, not communicating with Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Lately, other than the cold voice it made when issuing tasks, the system did not make a lot of fuss. It felt as if it had grown up overnight. Jiang Xiaoman was very pleased and relieved. But even until now, it still hadn’t spoken a word. It seemed like something was wrong.<br>
She curiously called it a few times before the system finally replied. “I’m not going to tell stories anymore.”<br>
“Why? The story with the little baby last time isn’t finished yet.”<br>
“I’m going to let things develop freely.” It wasn’t the cold mechanical voice, but a pitiful tone instead. Only when it was bugged or anxious would it emit electrical sounds. Jiang Xiaoman couldn’t figure out how it felt right now.<br>
The system said, “I can’t handle it anymore.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman frowned and defended herself, “I’m very obedient and reasonable. Why aren’t you telling me stories? Aren’t we good friends?”<br>
“The relationship has crumbled.”<br>
“Oh.” Jiang Xiaoman answered unhappily.<br>
She knew what a crumbling relationship meant.<br>
She occasionally grabbed the remote when Grandma was watching TV.<br>
Their small, old TV in the previous house looked like it would get blown away whenever there was rain or thunder. Other than Xiaoman’s favorite Monkey King, it also showed some family dramas.<br>
Grandma liked watching those kinds of dramas the most.<br>
Generally, it would have a family of a young couple and a mother-in-law.<br>
The mother-in-law would intervene with the young couple’s relationship and cause trouble here and there. In the end, the young couple wouldn’t be able to stand it anymore and their relationship crumbled; they would want to divorce. Jiang Xiaoman couldn’t understand the story and thought that it was too noisy, but Grandma liked it very much and watched very enthusiastically.<br>
What the young couple on TV said was very similar to what the system was saying.<br>
How should she answer? Should she say that she wanted a divorce?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman hesitated for a while, then decided not to answer this question. Because the young couple on TV who wanted to divorce due to their crumbling relationship never succeeded.<br>
Maybe the system was like that as well.<br>
They would always be good friends, and the system couldn’t leave her anyway.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman kept to her heart and soon went to bed happily.<br>
If the system knew what she was thinking, it would probably get so angry it would materialize.<br>
It didn’t say that to its host to cause trouble or threaten her. It really planned to take its hands off and let things develop naturally.<br>
The system really didn’t take it to heart.<br>
Couldn’t find her real parents? It didn’t matter. The host wasn’t blackening? It didn’t matter. The will of the world would follow the proper scenario.<br>
When the time came, the people who should meet would meet again, and things that should happen would happen.<br>
If the system got too anxious, it would only shorten its own lifespan.<br>
Anyways, it had been with Jiang Xiaoman for a long time. If anything, the system had learnt from Jiang Xiaoman to be good to oneself, to take things easy and to not compete with oneself. This was an important regiment to maintain one’s health, and it had learnt really well from her. After all, its host was very good at misinterpreting what it said, and always came up with an outrageous solution to treat herself well and take things easy.<br>
As a system, it should just follow its host’s footsteps.<br>
It slowly gave her tasks and waited for her to pay her debt. When the time came to upgrade then it would upgrade, and when the time came to do something it would make do somehow.<br>
Everything that must be there would be there.<br>
The system would become like a Buddhist.<br>
What else could it do otherwise?<br>
Surviving up till this point, it could only tell itself to be more open and rejoiceful.<br>

<p>Your Grandma Loves Me Too Much (3)<br>
Weekend arrived again.<br>
As usual, Jiang Xiaoman went with Yu Qingshi to his house.<br>
This time, even though she had already come here so many times and was familiar with the place, she still made very exaggerated expressions.<br>
“Wow! It’s so beautiful here!”<br>
“Wow! This looks so good!<br>
“Wow! I haven’t seen this little goldfish for a few days, and it has so grown big now!”<br>
Yu Qingshi faintly glanced at her and said, “The one from last time had died. Dad said that the Feng Shui was not good, so he replaced it with a bigger fish… Don’t you see that the color is different?”<br>
“Oh, I noticed.”<br>
“???”<br>
“Good friends should always praise each other.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman always had a lot of weird tenets, where did she even learn it from?<br>
Yu Qingshi couldn’t praise her with such an exaggerated expression and tone. He didn’t know what to praise her for. After being silent for a long time, he whispered, “… very cute.”<br>
“I know, but thanks.” Jiang Xiaoman was very stinky. Uncle also praised her like a fairy that descended to the world, the prettiest girl around, the flower of the village. In comparison, Yu Qingshi really did not know how to compliment people. Oh well, it didn’t matter. She was already happy as long as she was praised.<br>
“You’re welcome.”<br>
Sure enough, after complimenting each other, the mood improved a little bit.<br>
This time, Xiaoman did not come here empty-handed.<br>
Jiang Xiumei prepared a bag for her containing a lot of food.<br>
These were all things that Jiang Xiumei made, snacks from the countryside.<br>
They could not compare in material things, so they could only rely on the mind.<br>
This bag contained food that Jiang Xiumei learnt how to make. It was not easy to find them in the city.<br>
Jiang Xiumei had to go back to the village to get some of the ingredients; the process was very tedious.<br>
Yu Qingshi watched her take things out one by one from the bag. Smelling the aroma of food, he asked eagerly, “What are these?”<br>
“Food.” She said mysteriously. “Grandma said you definitely haven’t eaten these before, they’re very delicious! They’re very tasty and nutritious. After you eat them once, you’ll definitely want more!”<br>
“……”<br>
To be honest, Yu Qingshi was a little scared.<br>
He was a little suspicious of the food he was going to eat. He didn’t dare to ask, but he also didn’t dare to not eat them.<br>
Because Jiang Xiaoman had already shoved it in front of his mouth.<br>
If he didn’t eat it, she would definitely cry.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s eyes were wet, and with an ‘aaann’, he ate a piece of greenish thing that he did not know what it was made of.<br>
Munch munch. He chewed a few times.<br>
It was a bit sticky, and had the fragrance of rice and plants.<br>
It seemed to be quite normal, not made of weird stuff.<br>
The tears in Yu Qingshi’s eyes were forced back.<br>
He asked, “What is this?”<br>
“Mugwort rice cake1.” Jiang Xiaoman ate one too and said with an unclear voice, “It’s very delicious.”<br>
So far, so good.<br>
The weight in his heart was relieved.<br>
The glutinous rice cake tasted quite good. Jiang Xiumei considered that a child’s mouth was not very big and deliberately made them marble-sized, and Yu Qingshi ate a few of them at once.<br>
After that, he tried something that was crunchy and fragrant.<br>
It somewhat resembled crispy corners2, but was very fragrant.<br>
Because the first dish was normal, Yu Qingshi felt confident and bold. He thought that it was delicious and ate a few more.<br>
After eating them, he remembered to ask, “What is this one?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman liked this one very much. Munch munch munch, she was eating it with satisfaction and casually said, “Climbing Monkey.”<br>
“What is a Climbing Monkey?”<br>
“They’re cicada shells.”<br>
Yu Qingshi’s face turned green. He felt something was wrong when he heard cicada, but still struggled to ask. “Cicada… cicada shells?”<br>
“That’s right.”<br>
Blergh.<br>
The thing in his mouth was no longer fragrant.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman said, “Hurry up, this is very delicious. Grandma took a long time to catch them. She said they’re also medicine. After eating them, your ears would be sharp and your eyes bright. If it was not for you, she wouldn’t go through so much effort to catch them.”<br>
Yu Qingshi’s tears fell. “Grandma… really loves me too much.”<br>
【Ding Dong! Made Yu Qingshi cry once, bonus: +5 points]<br>
【Points have arrived. Balance -550】<br>
Jiang Xiaoman earned a lot of points this time, and finally there was only that much debt left.<br>
She got points and had something delicious to eat. She was very happy and started munching again.<br>
Eating good food, she was very happy.<br>
Yu Qingshi wouldn’t eat, so she was the one who finished them. Usually, she wanted to eat them but couldn’t. Only because of Yu Qingshi did she get to eat them again.<br>
It was very delicious. Jiang Xiaoman had a very happy day.<br>
Meanwhile, for Yu Qingshi, one day felt like a year.<br>
The two played together, and when Xiaoman went home in the evening, there was another surprise waiting for her.<br>
Jiang Xing was back.<br>
Not only did he return home, he also brought her a gift.<br>
A pet.<br>
A pig.<br>
He was a real man; he had fulfilled his promise!<br>

<p>Fragrance Is Very Cute (1)<br>
The pig was very small. It was not the white, fat kind. In fact, it looked a little bit thin.<br>
It probably wouldn’t taste that good.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman squatted on the ground and raised the little pig’s front leg. Her big pair of eyes were gazing at its little pair of eyes.<br>
She was looking at it, and at the same time, the pig was also looking at her. It was not afraid of her, and she was not afraid of it.<br>
“Wow!” She exclaimed. “Uncle, this pig is so cute!”<br>
“Of course! I found it after looking around for a long time, how can it not be cute?” Jiang Xing really had to look for it for a long time, because most pet shops didn’t sell those. There were mostly cats and dogs, and he was exhausted trying to find a pig. But because he was determined to buy his niece a pig, he persevered and was finally able to buy this little fragrant pig.<br>
All pigs looked the same. Honestly, Jiang Xiaoman didn’t really understand and couldn’t tell the difference between this pig and Big Flower and Little Flower back in the village.<br>
They also both looked like this when they were young.<br>
But this pig was prettier and more delicate compared to them.<br>
Its nose and mouth were softer and whiter. When it oinked, it stuck out its pink and tender tongue.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman played with it for a while, then raised her head and asked, “It’s so cute, can we eat it? It’s so small though, would it be enough for me and Grandma to eat? Will it grow bigger after we raise it for a while?<br>
The current Jiang Xiaoman was very concerned about food, especially meat.<br>
“This isn’t for you to eat, but to keep as a pet.” Jiang Xing said. “This is called a fragrant pig. It won’t get bigger even after you raise it. It will just stay this size. It’s going to be your playmate in the future, so give it a name.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman came to a realization.<br>
So it turned out that the pig’s position was similar to Yu Qingshi’s Miaomiao.<br>
Although she wanted a little friend of her own very much, raising Miaomiao cost a lot of money. It ate meat every day, and lived better than her. To be honest, she was very envious of Miaomiao.<br>
She didn’t even have meat to eat for herself. If she raised a fragrant pig, her future portion of meat would be even less.<br>
She was very reluctant to share the meat with the fragrant pig, and she also didn’t have the heart to let it follow her to endure hardships and eat only vegetables.<br>
“Uncle, I don’t want to raise a fragrant pig. You can give it away.” After thinking for a while, Jiang Xiaoman made up her decision with tears in her eyes. “If it eats a lot, it would starve if I took care of it. Mrs. Flower also eats very well, her mouth never stops chewing. If it doesn’t want to follow me and eat only vegetables, it would starve to death.”<br>
She didn’t want the fragrant pig to starve to death.<br>
“… didn’t you want to eat it just now?” Jiang Xing’s face twitched.<br>
“Because it had not been my friend yet just now, but now it is.”<br>
Children’s way of thinking had always been strange and erratic, especially their Xiaoman. Jiang Xing had long been used to it.<br>
After figuring out her thoughts, Jiang Xing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and explained to her. “It’s okay, it’s just a pig. We can afford it. Besides, pigs eat vegetables, not meat.”<br>
“Really?” Jiang Xiaoman’s eyes brightened, but it soon dimmed again. “But there’s no place to find hogweed in the city.”<br>
“…there are other alternatives.” Jiang Xing said. “Your Uncle Yu already told me everything. Grandma’s approach is wrong, Uncle will let you know.”<br>
After Yu Wencheng spoke with Jiang Xiaoman, he went to ask Jiang Xing if he had encountered any difficulties. Was there something that he could not speak about? Did he not have enough money to spend and would go bankrupt?<br>
If it wasn’t any of those, then he should go home and look at what was happening.<br>
After asking, Jiang Xing understood what happened. His head felt like it was going to explode. He wouldn’t interfere with how his mother educated the child.<br>
No pain, no gain. He had heard of that idiom when he was small. It was fine for Jiang Xiaoman to learn it.<br>
The problem was, Xiaoman overthink things too much.<br>
She didn’t even understand what bankruptcy was, but she still cried and became sad because of it. She had to live frugally, and things blew up.<br>
Wasn’t the reason he worked so hard was so that his whole family could live well?<br>
In order to comfort her and correct her thinking, he went and brought this fragrant pig home for her.<br>
He wanted to let her know that not only could their family afford to eat meat, they could also afford to raise pigs.</p>

<p>Fragrance Is Very Cute (2)<br>
“I, Your Uncle, has become awesome now. I can already hit back against my opponents.” Jiang Xing chuckled and said triumphantly. “Don’t worry, after we close the book this quarter, I will give you money right away. Money, Uncle already has money now, hahaha…”<br>
He couldn’t stop laughing.<br>
Jiang Xing himself did not expect that his foray into the residential districts would turn out so fruitful.<br>
Not only did he manage to get customers right from the source, he also… managed to attract an investor.<br>
Well, naturally, it was Yu Wencheng.<br>
Yu Wencheng told him that his idea was good and very promising, and that the two of them should continue working together. Jiang Xing invested the effort, and he invested the capital. Soon, they took over the whole city’s market, not giving that pretty boy any chance.<br>
If someone was willing to deliver money to his doors, of course Jiang Xing would happily accept it. He happily continued the money burning competition against the other party.<br>
After two or three months passed, the pretty boy who had been burning money still couldn’t beat them. And now, he seemed to have started running out of steam. He did not have enough money.<br>
Jiang Xing who had a healthy cash flow couldn’t help showing off.<br>
If it was not because he had been too busy, he would have come home a long time ago.<br>
That pretty boy was backed by his wife, while he had Boss Yu. Who was afraid of whom?<br>
“Then, can we live in a big house in the future?”<br>
“Yes, you can even be neighbors with your little friend.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman rubbed her head and fell into deep thought. A while later, she shook her head and said, “No, I don’t want to. Yu Qingshi said that he had to get up very early every day or else he would be late for school. Here, I can sleep for a while more. I only need a short walk to get to the kindergarten.”<br>
That was why Yu Qingshi made a fuss asking his family to move here, but he had not succeeded yet.<br>
Jiang Xing mysteriously said, “My four hundred thousand was not wasted.”<br>
The house might be dilapidated, but there was no need to question its location. It was very convenient for the children to go to school. It was a comfortable place to live in, so they did not rush to move out.<br>
After Jiang Xing gave Xiaoman the fragrant pig, he built a small pig pen in the yard. Although they hadn’t brought Mrs. Flower to the city, he still couldn’t escape the fate of raising pigs in his house. Jiang Xiaoman was very happy and excited. The only one who was not so happy was Jiang Xiumei.<br>
The fragrant pig was originally meant to be raised inside the house, but Jiang Xiumei wouldn’t allow it, so Jiang Xing had no choice but to build a pigpen in the yard. Fortunately, the place was quite big and spacious.<br>
Of course, the pig pen was not as simple as Mrs. Flower’s house back in the village, but was a luxurious pig villa version. The floor was covered in bright tiles. There was a small sleeping basket at the side, etc.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very envious when she saw it. She laid down beside the pigpen and refused to move, wondering whether she should sleep with the pig tonight.<br>
After all, that was also how Yu Qingshi raised Miaomiao.<br>
But how could Grandma let her sleep in the pigpen? Hearing Xiaoman’s shouts, she quickly carried her inside.<br>
Xiaoman had no choice but to give up.<br>
She named the little fragrant pig Fragrance. Back then, she decided on the name Little Fragrance instead, because she was afraid that if the fragrant pig was too fragrant, she wouldn’t be able to help but want to eat it.<br>
But after holding it now, Jiang Xiaoman realized that her worries were unnecessary.<br>
Although the pig was not smelly like Mrs. Flower, it could not be said to be very fragrant, so she did not have to worry about calling it Fragrance.<br>
When she went to Yu Qingshi’s house to play on the weekend, Jiang Xiaoman brought Fragrance with her.<br>
She made a leash for the pig, and tugged it along with much effort.<br>
Although the little fragrant pig was not big, its strength was a bit scary. Xiaoman had to use all her might to overpower it. Her pair of little hands held onto the rope, and she shouted towards Yu Qingshi’s house with face flushed, “Yu, Yu Qingshi… I, I brought Fragrance here to see you!”<br>
She was very tired. The little pig was really strong.<br>
Yu Qingshi ran out and was taken aback when he saw her with the pig she was holding.<br>
He knew that Jiang Xiaoman was raising a pet called Fragrance. Back at school, she mysteriously told him to guess what it was and said that she would bring it to see him on the weekend.<br>
Yu Qingshi guessed for a long time and thought about every possibility, but didn’t expect that Fragrance was a pig.<br>
A pig…<br>
Yu Qingshi squatted down, and tried to give it a friendly pinch. But once he reached its nose, he wasn’t able to pinch it. Instead, Fragrance snorted a few times to his face.<br>
He didn’t know what kind of expression he should make.</p>

<p>Fragrance Is Very Cute (3)<br>
After a short pause, he said. “My father has some guests at home today. How about we play in the flower garden?”<br>
“Okay.” Jiang Xiaoman brought her dear Fragrance over to play with Yu Qingshi. She didn’t really care where they were going to play.<br>
Two humans and one pig played together in the garden.<br>
Well, “play” might not be very accurate.<br>
It was Yu Qingshi sitting above the rockery while watching Jiang Xiaoman scolding and teaching Fragrance.<br>
When Jiang Xiaoman wanted to take it to the right, Fragrance would refuse, snort a few times and go to the left.<br>
One person and one pig were caught in a stalemate.<br>
And in the end, Jiang Xiaoman was defeated. She was tired and spent, and said helplessly, “Fine, fine. Since you’re still young and naïve, I will concede. We’ll go over there.”<br>
As soon as the strength in her hand loosened, Fragrance ran away like a wild horse that was suddenly let loose.<br>
Its goal was… the flowers in the flowerbed.<br>
“Oink oink oink…” In a blink of an eye, all the blooming flowers were gone.<br>
Yu Qingshi’s face went pale.<br>
He felt that he would probably get spanked.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was also very angry. She slapped Fragrance on its bottom and said angrily, “I’m not giving you any food tonight! You’re not allowed to eat anymore!”<br>
No one knew whether she could really talk to animals, but Fragrance really did stop eating the flowers. Instead, it used its snout to dig the soil on the flowerbed.<br>
“……”<br>
“Aiyo, it’s dirty!” Jiang Xiaoman was very angry and hit Fragrance’s bottom again.<br>
Like a mother and her child, Jiang Xiaoman treated Fragrance like a naïve kid. Yu Qingshi suddenly felt that since Jiang Xiaoman was noisy, her pig would also be noisy.<br>
Yu Qingshi used to think that Miaomiao was too quiet and had no other hobbies other than sleeping. Now he felt that Miaomiao was really an angel; Miaomiao was really too good.<br>
Yu Qingshi sat there quietly, watching Jiang Xiaoman teach Fragrance.<br>
When Jiang Xiaoman was holding its front legs and about to scold it again, Yu Qingshi finally couldn’t stand it anymore.<br>
“You… calm down. It doesn’t understand you.”<br>
“You’re not a pig, how do you know that it doesn’t understand?” Jiang Xiaoman blinked her eyes and repeated what Grandma once said. “Grandma said, when children are ignorant, you can spank them or scold them, but you must tell them the reason. If you don’t, how would they know what they did wrong? Fragrance is digging the soil in your house. If this becomes a bad habit and it digs the soil at my house, then my house would collapse.”<br>
“…” Well, Xiaoman’s house really was very dilapidated.<br>
Yu Qingshi couldn’t say anything, and could only stay quiet and let her continue.<br>
Well, he couldn’t stop her anyway.<br>
Just as Xiaoman regained her dignity and wanted to continue scolding Fragrance, a little girl suddenly popped her head in. She ran out from the room and stood in front of Yu Qingshi and Jiang Xiaoman with a very arrogant expression.<br>
“What are you doing?” the little girl asked.<br>
“I’m teaching it how a person should act.”<br>
“Idiot, how could a pig understand?” The little girl glanced at Yu Qingshi who was silent. She felt that he was really weird, and was a little afraid inside.<br>
But just now, she heard him talk to Jiang Xiaoman, and she felt a bit uncomfortable.<br>
She came here as a guest with her father. She originally wanted to make friends with the little boy, but he didn’t care about her.<br>
“It can.” Jiang Xiaoman inherited her protective nature from Grandma.<br>
Although she knew that Fragrance was very stupid and couldn’t understand her, she was very unhappy that the little girl looked down on it so much.<br>
Maybe Fragrance was addicted to digging the soil; as soon as the little girl appeared, it tried to bump into her with its snout. When it approached, its breath hit her legs. The little girl was frightened and said with a sharp voice. “Go away! You ugly pig!!”<br>
Xiaoman was furious. She finally experienced what it felt like to burn with anger!<br>
This little girl was very annoying!<br>
But she couldn’t really let Fragrance bump someone else. She could only desperately hold it back while scolding, “You’re the ugly one! Fragrance is so cute, don’t scold it!”<br>
“Ugly pig, ugly pig!” The little girl was scared of the pig. Before Fragrance could even touch her, she already began to cry.<br>
Maybe Xiaoman was really capable. After pulling on the rope until her hands went red, Fragrance really stopped rushing towards the little girl.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman breathed a sigh of relief. Just as her hands started relaxing, the little girl suddenly rushed forward and kicked Fragrance. Fragrance screamed ‘oink oink’ and ran around in panic.<br>
“What are you doing?!” Jiang Xiaoman was furious.<br>
“Wuu wuu wuu. Dad, help me! Quick!” The wolf was the first to cry wolf.<br>
She burst into tears and ran inside shouting, “Dad, someone is bullying me! It’s horrible here, I want to go home!”</p>

<p>Exchanging Father (1)<br>
The little girl cried very miserably. The people inside the house heard her cries and immediately ran to ask her what happened.<br>
“What happened? Don’t cry, don’t cry. Tell Dad, who’s bullying you?”<br>
A young handsome man came out from the house; he picked the little girl up and tried to coax her. It wasn’t clear what Yu Wencheng was doing; it did not seem like he was in the living room.<br>
The man looked very nervous and protective of the little girl.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman held Fragrance’s leash while she watched the man try to coax the little girl. For some reason, she felt like crying.<br>
“Dad, it’s her. She let her pig scare and headbutt me. This pig is dirty and smelly, I don’t want it to touch me.” The little girl was crying and looked very pitiful.<br>
She was very articulate, and managed to tell a whole story in just a few sentences.<br>
Liang Yuanqing’s face sank. He glanced at Jiang Xiaoman, then at her pig, then he sharply asked, “What is wrong with you? You didn’t take care of your pet and allowed it to hit my daughter?”<br>
“I didn’t…” Jiang Xiaoman’s big eyes started to fill with tears, but she stubbornly held them back from falling.<br>
Grandma told her that when you were arguing with someone, it was better to look strong. She mustn’t cry.<br>
If she cried, then she wouldn’t have energy. If her momentum fell, the other party would think that she was easy to bully and they would act even more unreasonably.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman wiped away the tears that did not manage to fall, and tried saying loudly, “Fragrance didn’t hit her, I held it back. If you don’t believe me, look at—”<br>
She showed him the red marks left on her palm, trying to prove her innocence.<br>
This little girl isn’t wearing any branded clothes, it even looks rather crude. I don’t think she’s the daughter of a rich family, how did she get here?<br>
“Then why would my daughter cry?” Liang Yuanqing glanced at the red marks on her palm. His expression didn’t change, and he said in a disgusted voice, “Take your dirty thing away from us.”<br>
Dirty thing? What dirty thing?<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was taken aback.<br>
She was being looked down upon.<br>
She looked at Fragrance, and finally let out a cry. Wuu wuu wuu!<br>
Fragrance was very obedient!<br>
Although it was a little naughty, it was a good pig. It’s not a dirty thing!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried loudly. With strength that seemed like it came out of nowhere, she hugged Fragrance as if she was looking for comfort or grasping at straws.<br>
“Fragrance is not a dirty thing! I bathe it every day! Although it is very playful, it never breaks stuff or hurts people! I said I already held it back, it was obviously you who kicked Fragrance yourself! You liar! Fragrance didn’t hit you! You’re just too cowardly and got shocked to tears! Liar, liar!”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was very angry and felt very aggrieved. The sounds of her cries and Fragrance’s oinks intertwined in the air.<br>
“The pig didn’t hit anyone.”<br>
Yu Qingshi stood next to Jiang Xiaoman and took her hand. Seeing that she was holding Fragrance desperately and almost running out of strength, he reached out his hands to help her lift the pig’s feet.<br>
“She’s the one who kicked the pig. I can be the witness.” Yu Qingshi said again.<br>
This little girl was very annoying.<br>
When she first arrived here, she tried to stroke Miaomiao against its wishes and almost got scratched. Now, she kicked Fragrance and tried to frame Jiang Xiaoman. She was really awful and annoying.<br>
Liang Yuanqing frowned. He looked at Yu Qingshi and hesitated, caught in an awkward position.<br>
He just wanted to stand up for his daughter. Jiang Xiaoman came out of nowhere, so he scolded her and that was all there was to it. But the same couldn’t be said for Yu Qingshi.<br>
He came here today for a business partnership.<br>
Or to be exact, he was pleading for one.<br>
Originally, he went into a price war with Jiang Xing to grab the market share, and felt that he was doing well. He was sure that under his money-burning strategy, Jiang Xing who didn’t have a strong foundation would definitely not be able to hold on for long and lose.<br>
Who would’ve thought that a Celestial Army would suddenly descend from the sky? Yu Wencheng suddenly appeared.<br>
Yu Wencheng came from a big family; he was rich and had good connections. Jiang Xing was nothing in his eyes, but if Yu Wencheng was added to the mix, they could beat him up so badly that even his mother wouldn’t be able to recognize him.<br>
There was no other way. A real man must be able to bend down and stretch. He had already spent too much money, so he could only come to Yu Wencheng’s doors to plead.<br>
There were no permanent enemies in business, only permanent benefits.<br>
Liang Yuanqing believed that as long as the conditions he offered were good enough to move him, Yu Wencheng would definitely give up on Jiang Xing and cooperate with him instead.<br>
He had been here all day to negotiate. The adults had not come to an agreement yet, but the children had already started to cause trouble.</p>

<p>Exchanging Father (2)<br>
Liang Yuanqing sighed heavily. Before he could open his mouth, the sound of his daughter’s cries rang in his ears again.<br>
“Wuu wuu wuu… Dad, I didn’t kick the pig. You know I’m a scaredy cat, it hit me by itself. I didn’t kick it. You don’t love me anymore, I’m going to tell Mom when we get home.”<br>
Fatherly love blinded Liang Yuanqing’s eyes for a moment.<br>
He glared at Jiang Xiaoman and said, “I know my daughter the best, she is not that kind of kid. Apologize to her, and I will forget this matter.”<br>
He ignored Yu Qingshi’s words.<br>
Although he was Yu Wencheng’s son, Yu Qingshi was just a young kid. He had heard that the kid had a psychological anomaly; perhaps he couldn’t even talk clearly.<br>
There was nothing to be afraid of.<br>
Liang Yuanqing stared coldy at the crying Jiang Xiaoman.<br>
Although he didn’t hit her physically, this kind of cold violence hurt a child’s heart even more than Grandma’s fists.<br>
Liang Yuanqing’s gaze felt as if he was accusing her of lying and being dishonest. She was the one who did the bullying, she wasn’t a good kid.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman cried so hard it was difficult to breathe, but she did not apologize. She refused to bow her head and admit her ‘mistake’.<br>
Yu Qingshi glared at Liang Yuanqing. His expression was very unhappy and irritated.<br>
He rarely had an episode nowadays, but it didn’t mean that he wouldn’t.<br>
Now, he was very irritated; he wanted to let his temper loose and throw things around.<br>
But Jiang Xiaoman’s crying voice rang in his ears.<br>
He abruptly resisted the irritation that was growing inside him, and returned to his expressionless face.<br>
He said in an indifferent voice, “Since you don’t believe it, let’s watch the surveillance tape.”<br>
“W…what?” Liang Yuanqing was taken aback.<br>
Even Liang Siyu, who was being held in his arms, stopped crying. Her eyes looked scared and at a loss. When she looked at Yu Qingshi, it felt like she was looking at some kind of devil.<br>
“I said, since you don’t believe me, let’s look at the surveillance tape.” Yu Qingshi stretched out his finger and pointed to the corner of the small garden, where a surveillance camera was installed. “I’ll call my Dad.”<br>
Liang Yuanqing didn’t know why he suddenly felt scared. He was covered in cold sweat. Before he could say anything, Yu Qingshi yelled, “Dad!”<br>
Yu Wencheng immediately rushed out.<br>
He was just picking up some documents in the study room; he didn’t hear the ruckus going on in the little garden.<br>
“What’s wrong, Son?”<br>
Yu Qingshi said, “This awful kid kicked Xiaoman’s pig and said that it was the pig that hit her. She’s not a piece of cabbage, why would the pig rush at her?”<br>
Liang Siyu was surprised for a moment, then she loudly cried. Wuu wuu wuu!<br>
“Dad, Dad, let’s go home quickly, I don’t want to stay here anymore. I don’t want to, I don’t want to, I’m not a piece of cabbage…”<br>
She began to cause trouble and act unreasonably.<br>
Liang Yuanqing smiled awkwardly, temporarily at a loss on what to say.<br>
“This… this is a misunderstanding… Mr. Yu, please let me explain.”<br>
Yu Wencheng didn’t know if it was a misunderstanding or not, but if his son asked for something, he would definitely oblige. Also, Jiang Xiaoman was crying very miserably. Yu Wencheng saw her and became very angry. He immediately had people bring out a monitor.<br>
Yu Wencheng acted very quickly. Liang Yuanqing had not figured out how to explain things yet when the monitor was brought out.<br>
On the screen, Jiang Xiaoman could be seen desperately holding back Fragrance, and she managed to keep it a distance away. But Liang Siyu suddenly rushed at it and kicked the pig until it bounced back and forth.<br>
Things began to become chaotic.<br>
Yu Wencheng had a face that looked like he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at Liang Yuanqing and Liang Siyu, who was crying in his arms. He didn’t say anything to them; instead, he told Jiang Xiaoman who was crying, “Here, come to Uncle.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman obediently walked over. Her grievance felt higher than the sky and deeper than the sea, and she couldn’t stop sobbing.<br>
“Good girl. Uncle knows that you are not that kind of unreasonable kid. You don’t have to apologize to anyone, you didn’t do anything wrong.”<br>
His words meant that Liang Siyu was the unreasonable kid.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman found an ally. She couldn’t wait to cling to him, crying out “Uncle Yu” as she cried in his arms.<br>
Yu Qingshi looked at her without blinking.<br>
His father was hugging Jiang Xiaoman, while he could only hug Fragrance. Normally, he would be jealous. But seeing that Xiaoman was very aggrieved today, he would let her borrow his Dad for a while. Just for a while.<br>
Fragrance oinked a few times, trying to nibble on Yu Qingshi’s hand, but he held it down mercilessly.<br>
He was not Jiang Xiaoman and didn’t have as much patience as she did.<br>
Liang Yuanqing listened to her daughter cry while feeling agitated inside. At the end of the day, she was his daughter, and he couldn’t not care about her.</p>

<p>Exchanging Father (3)<br>
He said with a dry smile. “Mr. Yu, it seems that there’s a misunderstanding. I didn’t know that it was actually like this.”<br>
He spanked Liang Siyu’s bottom while he said that. But he only pretended to do so.<br>
Yu Wencheng would not really pursue the matter with a kid, right?<br>
But who would’ve thought that Liang Siyu would not cooperate?<br>
She was a spoiled child who had never received a spanking at home. She was already feeling aggrieved just by the spanking, but her father actually did it in front of so many people. What face did she have left?!<br>
Liang Siyu cried loudly again and began to struggle.<br>
“Dad doesn’t love me anymore! You don’t love me anymore! It’s not my fault! You clearly told me once that if I saw something weird, I should kick it or it would hurt me. You told me, safety first! The pig got so close to me and scared me to death!”<br>
Liang Yuanqing smiled so awkwardly his mouth couldn’t stretch anymore.<br>
He was so angry that he spanked her a few more times, teaching the child who messed things up a lesson.<br>
Didn’t she know that she had caused a disaster?!<br>
Liang Siyu felt so much pain that she cried even more.<br>
“Mr. Yu, I—”<br>
“Please go back.” Yu Wencheng’s face was sullen as he coldly said, “You were originally a guest, so I treated you well, thinking we might become friends in the future. But I didn’t expect…”<br>
He looked down at Jiang Xiaoman who was crying and sighed in his heart.<br>
He had known Jiang Xiaoman for so long, but he had never seen her cry so much.<br>
“I didn’t expect such a thing to happen. Although it was just a dispute between children, you could see one or two things from how someone teaches their child. Although I am not a good person, I have strict principles about children. I do not like to associate with people with crude behaviors.” Yu Wencheng said, “This child, Xiaoman, is our family’s benefactor. Everyone here loves her, and no one would ever think she is a dirty thing. If she wants to, she can live in my house for the rest of her life.”<br>
Yu Qingshi also jumped in and added, “Yes, my father is her father, and my home is her home.”<br>
Yu Wencheng gave his son a quick glance, his fist feeling itchy.<br>
Did this kid know what he was saying?!<br>
He had never seen him talk so much!<br>
Really, when a son grew up, his father wouldn’t be able to hold him back!<br>
Aiya!<br>
Being ridiculed for bad conduct, Liang Yuanqing felt humiliated. His face turned from white to green; he was so angry he felt like punching someone!<br>
He left the Yu family’s house while holding Liang Siyu. His face was sullen and his heart was in chaos.<br>
Liang Siyu was still crying on their way home.<br>
Liang Yuanqing frowned, thinking of the troubles at home. He thought about how his in-laws might ridicule him if his business failed and he lost all his investment!<br>
This good thing was ruined by this little girl!<br>
The hole was getting bigger and bigger, and he was afraid that his in-laws would reveal everything to the bottom.<br>
The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and finally he couldn’t help but spank Siyu again.<br>
This was the first time he had spanked his child.<br>
Liang Siyu was still acting spoiled and was angry at her father, but this time the spanking was unexpectedly real. She was so scared she was trembling, and the two were engaged in a cold war all the way home.<br>
After Liang Yuanqing left, Yu Wencheng and Yu Qingshi coaxed Xiaoman until she stopped crying and smiled again.<br>
At that moment, a notification sound from the system rang in her mind.<br>
[Task completed. Target locked, biological father and the heroine. Bonus +50 points]<br>
【Points arrived. Balance: -500】<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was taken aback and asked, “Was that my father just now?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“Why didn’t you say it earlier?”<br>
“When I’m too anxious, I will get bugs and crash.” The system said. “I could only talk after he left.” The system had learned to act after making its decision carefully. It was no longer over eager and in a hurry. “Host, are you happy?” The system asked.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman responded vaguely. She looked at her points balance and the fifty points she earned, and said unhappily, “I don’t want that kind of father.”<br>
She was not happy at all.<br>
When she thought back hard now, she didn’t have a strong impression of his face. She only remembered his face vaguely.<br>
All she could say was that he looked like the Yaksha from Journey to the West; he looked evil, cursed and ugly.<br>
A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a child born to a mouse will dig holes.<br>
If she was dirty, then he must’ve been dirtier than her! He must’ve been picked up from the trash can!<br>
She thought about it angrily and decided to change her wish.<br>
Starting from that day, Jiang Xiaoman’s wish changed from getting first place to exchanging her father.</p>

<p>Did You Get Beaten? Yes (1)<br>
After meeting the Liang father and daughter pair at Yu Qingshi’s house that weekend, Jiang Xiaoman hadn’t come to play with Yu Qingshi again.<br>
When Yu Qingshi went to her to ask, she said that she was feeling sad, and needed some quiet time alone.<br>
“Don’t be sad.” Yu Qingshi said. “Didn’t I help you scold them until they went back? My Dad said that he would never let them come to my house again in the future.”<br>
He thought Jiang Xiaoman was afraid that she would meet Liang Yuanqing and his daughter again.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman shook her head and said sorrowfully, “You’re still young, you don’t understand my sorrow.”<br>
“…” At that moment, Yu Qingshi felt the urge to turn around and leave. Jiang Xiaoman was always capable of talking very irritatingly while putting up an innocent face.<br>
But she was his good friend after all, so he resisted the urge.<br>
Yu Qingshi continued to comfort her. “I will help you if you encounter something similar in the future, so no one will wrong you.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman still shook her head. She wiped her face; she felt very sad but didn’t want to cry.<br>
She just wanted a good father.<br>
Uncle Yu was very good, but he was Yu Qingshi’s father. If she took his father, then she would be a bad person. Yu Qingshi was already very pitiful and his father was the only thing he had. She couldn’t snatch him.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman couldn’t find a father, so she didn’t want to go to his house. Because Uncle Yu was so kind, she was afraid she wouldn’t be able to hold back.<br>
Jiang Xiaoman sighed quietly, her face devoid of life. When she left, the silhouette of her back seemed to convey “I need some quiet time”.<br>
Often, Yu Qingshi didn’t even understand what she was thinking, so naturally he couldn’t understand her dilemma either. But his good friend was in a bad mood, so he would try everything to make her happy again.<br>
It was just that he was a kid who wasn’t good at speaking and didn’t know how to comfort others. He wasn’t like Jiang Xiaoman, who always said surprising things and wouldn’t stop until she reached her purpose.<br>
After thinking about it, it seemed that only Miaomiao could solve this difficulty.<br>
After all, Xiaoman always seemed to like Miaomiao very much whenever she came to his house. Miaomiao should still be able to attract her attention, right? Although it made him a little sad that he wasn’t as good as Miaomiao, it didn’t matter as long as she was happy. He was willing to use Miaomiao to coax her.<br>
A few days later, he brought her a picture of Miaomiao.<br>
Yu Qingshi said, “Miaomiao has been sterilized. Lately, it doesn’t have an appetite and only eats half a can of catfood. Usually, it would eat one can after another like its stomach was a bottomless hole. Look at its head. My dad said that it needed to wear a cone so it won’t lick its wounds.”<br>
The Miaomiao in the picture was wearing a small cone around its neck. Its hair was orange and it kept dozing off. Its head looked like a small orange ball of fur, and at first glance, it looked similar to a sunflower in full bloom.<br>
Miaomiao’s head was drooping down. Its face was unhappy, and it looked as if life had no more meaning.<br>
So cute!<br>
Miaomiao, how could it be so cute!<br>
How could there be such a cute cat!<br>
Jiang Xiaoman couldn’t help but smile, and grumbled, “Miaomiao is getting fatter and fatter.”<br>
“Well, I like to take it on a walk after a meal nowadays.” Yu Qingshi spoke while the iron was hot. He hesitated and said, “Miaomiao seems to miss you, do you want to come to my house?”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman was a little tempted. After all, she hasn’t played with the Miaomiao-with-a-cone yet.<br>
But…<br>
After hesitating for a while, Jiang Xiaoman said, “No, I can just give Fragrance a cone when I get home. I’m sure it would be cute with one too.”<br>
She had never thought about dressing Fragrance up or giving it hats before. Right now, it felt as if a new world was opened in front of her. If Fragrance could be so cute as well, she would definitely like it even more.<br>
“…that might not be possible.” Yu Qingshi disagreed without thinking. After all, they were of two different species and looked completely different. Fragrance body was so round, would the cone even fit?<br>
His family’s Miaomiao was already using the biggest cone but it was still very tight. Yu Qingshi couldn’t imagine what cone could be used for Fragrance.<br>
He continued to invite her sincerely, “If you want to put a cone on Fragrance, I have a few others at home that I can lend you.”<br>
“It’s ok, I’ll just make one myself.” Jiang Xiaoman said. “The cone looks like Grandma’s straw hat.”<br>
She didn’t learn handicrafts for nothing.<br>
Inviting her several times without success, Yu Qingshi could only sigh helplessly.<br>
After thinking about it for a while, he said sincerely, “Just come to my house and take it, otherwise you might get spanked. Or I can bring you one tomorrow.”<br>
Jiang Xiaoman put her arms on her hips and snorted. She said smugly, “No way, Grandma really loves me, not like Dad at all. As long as I’m not naughty, she wouldn’t spank me. Grandma said that she would spank me at most once a day. If children are spanked too much, they will be broken.”<br>
“Well, alright.” Yu Qingshi didn’t force her.</p>

<p><strong>Did You Get Beaten? Yes (2)</strong></p>
<p>When she went home that day, Jiang Xiaoman happily made a cone for Fragrance based on Miaomiao’s photo.</p>
<p>…of course it was impossible for her to succeed.</p>
<p>She might have the ability to craft it, but Fragrance really grew big without restraint. It wasn’t enough to cut one straw hat, so she cut up a second, then a third.</p>
<p>When she cut up the third one, Xiaoman got spanked.</p>
<p>Grandma was still Grandma after all, and her fists was still very hard.</p>
<p>Xiaoman felt really wronged, and her eyes were still red when she went to school the next day.</p>
<p>Yu Qingshi noticed it and ran over to ask, “Did you get spanked yesterday?”</p>
<p>“…” Jiang Xiaoman choked in anger.</p>
<p>She felt that Yu Qingshi was very bad and annoying.</p>
<p>But they were good friends now, so he must not have meant to say it.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman played with her fingers, then lowered her head and said in a low voice, “Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“Luckily, I’ve brought you one.” Yu Qingshi said. “Since you’re not coming to my house, then I will go to your house to play.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was very moved and said, “Okay.”</p>
<p>As long as there were guests at home, she would probably not get spanked.</p>
<p>Wuu wuu wuu. Her life was so difficult, she was so miserable…</p>
<p>Originally, she thought that Uncle’s childhood was a miserable one. Now, she knew that her time had just not come yet.</p>
<p>Thus, they came to an agreement. Over the weekend, Yu Qingshi went to her house to play.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Jiang Xiumei knew that Yu Qingshi was coming to their house as a guest, so she specially prepared a feast for him.</p>
<p>Usually, it was Jiang Xiaoman that went to Yu Qingshi’s house every day. Now, finally it was Yu Qingshi’s turn to come to their house. Of course, they had to treat him well.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiumei said, “Xiaoman told me that you especially like eating cicada shells. I caught some cicada last time and there are some left, I’ll fry them all for you two to snack on. The weather is getting colder so I couldn’t catch them anymore. When next summer comes, Grandma will catch more for you.”</p>
<p>The kid liked the food she made, so Jiang Xiumei was very happy.</p>
<p>Yu Qingshi was taken aback and looked at Jiang Xiaoman, who was lowering her head with a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>She… she did say that.</p>
<p>She was the one who liked them, not Yu Qingshi. Every time, they went to her stomach instead.</p>
<p>As long as Yu Qingshi liked them, Grandma would keep making more and she would be able to eat more.</p>
<p>Wuu wuu wuu. She lied; she was not a good kid.</p>
<p>But the cicada shells were really delicious! They were so fragrant and crispy!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman raised her head and looked at Yu Qingshi with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Qingshi said, “Thank you, Grandma. I like them very much.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiumei happily left to cook for him.</p>
<p>When the cicada shells came to the table, it was Yu Qingshi’s turn to burst into tears.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman patted him on the shoulder and said affectionately, “It’s okay, I’ll help you eat them.”</p>
<p>Then, munch munch munch, she finished them all.</p>
<p>Yu Qingshi’s mood was complicated, but he obediently thanked her.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman waved her hand, “It’s nothing. Good friends must help each other.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman finished eating the cicada shells. At this moment, Yu Qingshi’s eyelashes were still stained with tears, and she remembered to ask the system for points.</p>
<p>“…” Host, you didn’t forget to do tasks and get points even when you’re enjoying a feast. You’re really working hard!</p>
<p>The system gave her 5 points, and her debt was now only -495 points.</p>
<p>Looking at the balance, the system almost shed bitter tears.</p>
<p>Its life was really too difficult.</p>
<p>This really was the most difficult host to guide.</p>
<p>The system said, “Host, I won’t force you to do tasks in the future.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Since when have you forced me?”</p>
<p>In her view, the reason she wanted to help the system was because it was too pitiful and miserable. She wanted to protect it and save it from trouble.</p>
<p>There was no coercion.</p>
<p>The system was silent for a while. It ignored the topic and continued, “It’s hard for you to make kids cry now.”</p>
<p>“Eh, yeah.” She sighed.</p>
<p>Her little friends were not as easy to fool anymore.</p>
<p>When she first entered kindergarten, everyone was still unfamiliar with each other. She could harvest a lot of tears just by snatching their things randomly.</p>
<p>It was different now.</p>
<p>The kids were getting older and more mature, so it wasn’t as easy to fool them. Their relationship with her was also getting better and better, and it was difficult to make them cry every time.</p>
<p>It was difficult to earn points.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, in the entire Class Three, other than Teacher Yang, none of the children had escaped her evil clutch and they had all been made to cry.</p>
<p>She had hoped that the system would understand her difficulties and not always give her tasks to make someone cry.</p>
<p>It was really difficult to do.</p>
<p>[Achievement task: Make someone hate you to the bones, unforgettable for life.</p>

<p>Reward: 500 points]</p>
<p>“???” Jiang Xiaoman froze.</p>
<p>She was a child that had seen the vast world, but she had never seen something as big as 500 points.</p>
<p>The system said, “It’s the ultimate essence of a villainess. A villainess who cannot make people grit their teeth in hatred and curse her is not a good villainess.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Jiang Xiaoman didn’t want to do this task.</p>

<p><strong>Did You Get Beaten? Yes (3)</strong></p>
<p>Just with rough assumptions, if she smashed a plate or cut apart a hat, then Grandma would spank her. If she wanted to make Grandma hate her to the bones and remember it for life, she’d probably have to dig out the house’s foundation.</p>
<p>That’s too tiring.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to move. If the house collapsed, she would have no place to live.</p>
<p>The system did not force her.</p>
<p>Achievement task was not a main task, nor was it a side task for earning points. It was just an achievement. Generally speaking, it was difficult to complete.</p>
<p>If she could do it, that’s great. If not, then it’s fine. The system had learned to take the initiative to excuse the host.</p>
<p>If you wanted to talk about working hard, then who wasn’t working hard? That was what the system thought.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>It was getting colder and colder.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing finally stopped being so busy when the New Year’s Eve was approaching and Xiaoman was having her winter vacation.</p>
<p>He had made a lot of profit from the business. Although he had not moved from his house to live in a villa, the house in the city now had a landline installed and a refrigerator. He also covered Fragrance’s pen with a roof and fencing. It looked more and more exquisite and beautiful.</p>
<p>It was so beautiful that Jiang Xiaoman wished her body could shrink a little bit so she could get in and play with Fragrance.</p>
<p>After Jiang Xing came back, he gave her a big red envelope.</p>
<p>“Wow!” Jiang Xiaoman exclaimed as she looked at the thick stack of money in her hand.</p>
<p>She had never counted so many red-colored bills. It was a lot of money!</p>
<p>From now on, she could eat meat, make phone calls, and invite Yu Qingshi to beef noodles as much as she wanted! She could even pay for extra beef!</p>
<p>Jiang Xing said, “I, Your Uncle, had beaten that little pretty boy so badly he had to throw away his armor and angrily run back to his in-laws. How shameful.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xing experienced a lot of ups and downs this year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Heavens still granted him luck, and his strong opponent was eventually defeated.</p>
<p>When he heard that the little pretty boy was leaving the city in anger and returned to his in-laws, he was so happy he couldn’t sleep. He mocked him under the guise of seeing him off.</p>
<p>Finally, he managed to see his face when his in-laws ridiculed him.</p>
<p>That scene was chaotic, but also felt very refreshing.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman also put her hands on her waist and scolded, “So shameful.”</p>
<p>After that, she remembered that she hadn’t seen the pretty boy that her Uncle kept mentioning. Who was it?</p>
<p>By the way, what was a pretty boy?</p>
<p>Since she couldn’t figure it out, she didn’t dwell on it for long. She never made life harder for herself.</p>
<p>She counted her money happily. But before she could finish, it was taken away by Grandma!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was unhappy and said, crying a little, “Grandma, that’s the New Year’s money that Uncle gave me… He said that the New Year is coming soon.”</p>
<p>“I know. Here, for you.” Jiang Xiumei pulled a sheet of Grandpa Mao<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;and added<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;yuan. It could count as giving New Year’s money.</p>
<p>Xiaoman looked at her New Year’s money that had shrunk many, many times and cried.</p>
<p>“Grandma is mean! You robbed my New Year’s money! You never did this before!!”</p>
<p>How could it be the same now?’</p>
<p>Back in the village, the red envelopes she received were just a few cents and didn’t add up to much. So they were treated as her allowance, for her to buy some snacks.</p>
<p>But when Jiang Xing gave her a few thousand Yuan, how could she let the child hold so much money?</p>
<p>Confiscated.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman finally had the childhood experience of having New Year’s money confiscated.</p>
<p>New Year’s was near, and it was customary to go back to one’s hometown to celebrate it. They had no relatives in the city, and the New Year atmosphere was not very strong. Jiang Xiumei quickly told the kids to pack up to go back to the village.</p>
<p>In addition to her textbooks and homework, Jiang Xiaoman also brought the little red flowers from kindergarten.</p>
<p>She wanted to take them back and show them to Teacher Tang. Even when she was in the city, she was still very obedient and hardworking, not letting down his teaching!</p>
<p>She was very awesome!</p>
<p>It was not easy to take Fragrance, so it was sent to the pet shop for a while.</p>
<p>When she left, Jiang Xiaoman wiped her tears and reluctantly said goodbye to Fragrance through the glass window.</p>
<p>The pigs at home were raised by the grandma next door, and it was practically half given to her. It was just that she also had her own pigs and couldn’t afford to raise two sows, so after hearing that the Jiang family was coming back for New Year, the two families discussed and decided to slaughter the pig.</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at <b>Wuxia</b>World.Site Only</p>
<p>The pig was divided into two, and half of it was given to the grandma next door, while the other half was for the Jiang family’s New Year.</p>
<p>When Jiang Xiaoman returned to the village, what greeted her was Mrs. Flower’s body.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Flower, after losing her beloved daughters one after the other, it also finally became this year’s New Year Pig.</p>

<p><strong>The System’s New Year’s Money (1)</strong></p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman cried miserably.</p>
<p>She sat on the door threshold, looking at Mrs. Flower’s body and the pigpen where it once lived. She was very sad, and stayed there wiping her tears over and over again.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing brought her a piece of charsiu<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>.</p>
<p>It had a very beautiful color due to soy sauce and burnt caramel, it looked very delicious and made people salivate.</p>
<p>The charsiu was made with Mrs. Flower’s meat.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing said, “For pigs, the best destiny for them is to eat when alive, and to be eaten when dead. If you eat it happily, Mrs. Flower would also have died satisfied.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman sobbed and said in a low voice, “That’s nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Whether it’s nonsense or not, you will know when you eat it. You can cry when it’s time to cry, but you also have to eat when it’s time to eat.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman followed his words. She lowered her head and took a bite. She chewed a few times, then her mouth flattened.</p>
<p>“It’s not delicious at all!” Jiang Xiaoman instantly felt that Mrs. Flower had died in vain even more, and cried even louder.</p>
<p>Of course it didn’t taste good.</p>
<p>An old sow’s meat was not as tender as a piglet, and it was hard to chew. It didn’t taste good because the meat was too chewy.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing didn’t enjoy eating it either.</p>
<p>If it was up to him, he would let it die naturally and bury it. But his mother was still very frugal and thrifty even though they were already more prosperous now. Mrs. Flower had to be eaten.</p>
<p>Old folks really appreciated food and would never waste them. He could only close his eyes and continue chewing.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing sighed. Xiaoman didn’t want to eat the charsiu, so he had to eat it.</p>
<p>She was so tired from crying, and soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>Even in her sleep, she was still crying with all her strength. Her eyes and nose were red from all the crying, and she looked very miserable.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing picked her up and put her on the bed.</p>
<p>Their ancestral house had been unoccupied for a while; the bed and mattress emitted a musty smell.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing wiped down the bed perfunctorily and placed her on it, then covered her with a small blanket.</p>
<p>Half a pig was still a large amount of meat, and the three people in their family couldn’t finish it. Holding a kitchen knife in his hand<em>, chop chop</em>, Jiang Xing cut half of it away and placed it in a basket to send to Teacher Tang.</p>
<p>This year, he could finally drive there directly. He didn’t have to carry the basket all the way there himself.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing and Yu Wencheng had a good relationship. Over the past year, he often borrowed a car from the mine and made a rough and simple road that could accommodate a car.</p>
<p>The road was very wide. It was easy to traverse and very convenient.</p>
<p>Now, Jiang Xing had a very good reputation here. Everyone said that he was someone who returns favors and doesn’t forget about his roots.</p>
<p>All the old folks always praised him whenever he was mentioned.</p>
<p>No one would’ve thought that back then, they would shake their head at this rascal; right now, he had already found success.</p>
<p>The Heavens really played tricks on human lives.</p>
<p>When Xiaoman woke up, Jiang Xing had already prepared everything.</p>
<p>He pulled her up and said, “Let’s go to Teacher Tang.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman heard that and spun around in place a few times worriedly.</p>
<p>They were going to see Teacher Tang now? But she had just been crying! Was her nose still red? Was her eyes still swollen?</p>
<p>Wuu wuu wuu, why didn’t he say so earlier!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was unhappy. But she still had to visit Teacher Tang.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, she stuffed the homework and textbooks she had prepared, as well as the little red flowers she had brought into her school bag. She wanted to take them all with her to show to Teacher Tang.</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at <b>Wuxia</b>World.Site Only</p>
<p>Teacher Tang was not surprised that they came.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman showed him her treasures, taking out her little red flowers one by one. Teacher Tang was also very cooperative and praised her with a grateful look, “Xiaoman is really amazing. In the future, you must continue working hard…”</p>
<p>The little one grew up very fast. He felt that it hadn’t been long since the last time he saw her, but she had already grown so big.</p>

<p><strong>The System’s New Year’s Money (2)</strong></p>
<p>She was taller now, no longer that little turnip anymore.</p>
<p>Her eyes had also become livelier and she was more confident, speaking more articulately.</p>
<p>Xiaoman nodded vigorously and loudly said, “I will! Uncle said that after the summer vacation, I won’t be going to kindergarten anymore. I’m going to elementary school!”</p>
<p>“Good, good, good.” Teacher Tang praised her again and again, and continued chatting for a while. Jiang Xing saw that he didn’t seem to be in very good spirits, so he took Xiaoman and went home.</p>
<p>Teacher Tang was already very old, and his stamina was no longer that good.</p>
<p>The elementary school in the village relied on him, and he had a lot of tasks pressuring him.</p>
<p>Life was not easy for the old man either.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The next day, Jiang Xiaoman found the New Year picture’s doll costume her uncle bought last year, and tried to put it on to ask for New Year’s money.</p>
<p>But who would’ve thought, after just a year, she couldn’t wear it anymore!</p>
<p>She had already grown too big!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was a bit happy and a bit sad when she realized it.</p>
<p>On one hand, she was happy that she had finally grown a bit taller. She didn’t need to be afraid that she couldn’t win when she fought others in the future. And if Grandma was going to hit her, she could evade more quickly!</p>
<p>On the other hand, she was sad because she could not act cute anymore!</p>
<p>She was not cute anymore when she was already so big!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman stuffed the New Year picture’s doll costume in the bottom of the trunk with a sour face.</p>
<p>She was now an adult, one year older than before. She couldn’t cry at every little thing, she had to be strong!</p>
<p>After she finished storing it, Xiaoman helped her Grandma clean up the place.</p>
<p>Grandma said that they had to wash out all the filth in the house today, and hang the word “Fortune” on the door. That was what New Year should be like!</p>
<p>She was a very diligent child that had helped Grandma with work ever since she was young. Naturally, she was not just idling by. When she was sweeping her room, Xiaoman suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>She ran into a gap in the window and took out a red envelope after a lot of effort.</p>
<p>The color on the envelope had faded and it looked as if it had been eroded by the wind and cold. There were even some holes on it left by insects.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman wiped the dust off with her hands and took a look inside.</p>
<p>There were fifty cents.</p>
<p>“Brother System, didn’t you say that if I put it in a secret corner, you would take it away? Why is this New Year money red envelope still here after a year?” Jiang Xiaoman’s heart fell and she was flustered.</p>
<p>The system did not know what to say and could only stay silent.</p>
<p>Back then, Xiaoman had been pestering it too much. She gave it a red envelope containing 50 cents and insisted that it take it. When the system said that it didn’t have any hands and couldn’t take it, she didn’t believe the system.</p>
<p>She said that whenever she exchanged candies with it, it could make it appear from thin air like a magic trick. Why did it suddenly not have any hands to take it with this time? If it really didn’t have any hands, then how did it give her candies?</p>
<p>…Her nonsense really made the system helpless. It had no choice but to tell her that if she put it in a secret corner, the system would take it and it would empty itself.</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at <b>Wuxia</b>World.Site Only</p>
<p>It had thought that a child would forget things quickly. Who would’ve thought that its host was an aberration; she still remembered after a whole year.</p>
<p>The system didn’t say anything. Jiang Xiaoman narrowed her mouth, held back a little, then softly said, “Oh, I forgot. You were bullied by the big systems miserably. If you took the red envelope, do you need to exchange them for points too? I understand your difficulties.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. That’s it.” The system’s brain quickly turned. Although it was a bit ashamed of deceiving its host, it still felt magnanimous.</p>
<p>After Jiang Xiaoman said that, she continued, “If you can’t take money, you can take points, right? Can I give you a 5 point red envelope?”</p>
<p>The system was stunned silly. It was going to buffer again.</p>

<p>The System’s New Year’s Money (3)</p>
<p>After experiencing so many unthinkable things, it thought that it would no longer be surprised by her host’s behavior. Ever since it regarded this as a Buddhist mission and upgraded into a Buddhist system, it thought that nothing could affect it anymore.</p>
<p>But right now… it felt as if its brain was going to short circuit again!</p>
<p>Human children, what kind of horrible beings are they?!</p>
<p>It really couldn’t stand it anymore!</p>
<p>The system almost burst into tears. “Of course I can, but…”</p>
<p>After a while, the system reminded her. “Didn’t you want to keep your points as life-saving insurance?”</p>
<p>In case you didn’t know, no matter how the system coaxed her or intimidated her to make her more arrogant and use more points to enjoy life, she wouldn’t spend even 1 point!</p>
<p>She wouldn’t eat candies or biscuits anymore, and also stopped any other bad habits that used up points!</p>
<p>The host said that she was saving them to save her uncle or herself, in case she was beaten half-dead! They were very important things, did the host forget?!</p>
<p>It had to remind her!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman rubbed her head, and said embarrassedly. “Although that is true, I haven’t been beaten half-dead in the past year. It’s not being used at the moment. Uncle is also very busy, so he doesn’t have the time to run away from home. Besides, it’s only five points. Do you not like them?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t dislike them.” Only someone who has been in poverty truly understood the value of money. The system knew that even 1 point was very valuable.</p>
<p>Wuu wuu wuu. Host, you’re so kind. Wuu wuu wuu.</p>
<p>The system finally accepted Jiang Xiaoman’s New Year’s money.</p>
<p>This year, it didn’t give her New Year’s money anymore.</p>
<p>One reason was that it really did not have any more points; it had to work hard to accumulate more points. The other reason was that Xiaoman said that she had grown up; she insisted that New Year’s money was something the elders gave the juniors, so she couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>…and many other things.</p>
<p>Elders and juniors??? What did its host take it for??</p>
<p>The system was going to buffer again.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman didn’t know about the storm happening in the system’s mind. She only knew that she had spent the points. Even though she didn’t get anything, she was even happier than when she was exchanging them for candies.</p>
<p>She really had become a grown-up adult!</p>
<p>The system was still very small and miserable, being bullied every day. Aiya, there was no way around it. She could only give it a red envelope to chase away its misfortune.</p>
<p>Grandma said that New Year’s money brought good luck. The system was so miserable before and was always caught in trouble. It must be because it didn’t take her New Year’s money.</p>
<p>Things would definitely get better this year!</p>
<p>On the second day of New Year, all the wives in the village went home to their maternal family. Without any children around, the environment quickly became tranquil.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiumei had no relatives to go home to. She was bored and went to the school cafeteria to warm the stove, hoping that the Kitchen God would bless the students with a delicious meal.</p>
<p>She had been doing this job for many years. Even though she was no longer working at the elementary school now, she still felt attached to it.</p>
<p>Jiang Xing was wandering outside again.</p>
<p>He went to find his brothers in the logistics team. His brothers formed a crowd following behind him, drinking and shouting. Everyone was just idling by.</p>
<p>Xiaoman was the only one left at home with nothing to do.</p>
<p>She was really bored.</p>
<p>Even Mrs. Flower was gone. She couldn’t even feed the pigs even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Jiang Xiaoman wanted to call Yu Qingshi. But after thinking about it, this was the second day of the New year. Shouldn’t he also be going back to his maternal family to visit his relatives?</p>
<p>Wait, did he have a maternal family?</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman tapped her head but couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at <b>Wuxia</b>World.Site Only</p>
<p>While she was thinking, a guest came over to her house.</p>
<p>“Xiaoman, are you alone at home?”</p>
<p>She knew the visitor.</p>
<p>Although she had only met him a few times, she knew that when Grandma cursed him, she had called him Hong Xingguo. He was supposedly her Granduncle.</p>
<p>What kind of thing was a Granduncle? Was it some kind of food?</p>

<p>I’ll Die in Front of Your Eyes (1)</p>
<p>The villagers were simple and honest people, and everyone was closely related. Just by crossing the road, you could probably bump into a relative. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that you didn’t need to lock your house at night.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was the only one in the Jiang family right now, and she did not have a habit of locking the door during the day.</p>
<p>When she heard that voice, the person was already inside and she couldn’t prevent him from entering.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman glanced cautiously at him and loudly said, “What do you want? Grandma will be home soon!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous, don’t be nervous.” Hong Xingguo gave what he felt was a friendly smile, but in reality he looked like the Wolf in “Little Red Riding Hood” who pretended to be Grandma. He was also carrying a bag on his back which looked to be packed to the brim.</p>
<p>To dispel her cautiousness, Hong Xingguo put the bag down and took out a lot of miscellaneous trinkets from it.</p>
<p>“This is a windmill that Granduncle made himself. Here, for you.”</p>
<p>He really made the windmill himself. Jiang Xiaoman believed him with just a glance because the windmill looked crude and ugly. Teacher Yang had also taught them how to make one in the handicraft class.</p>
<p>Cut a piece of paper into four, then put a nail and stick it to a wooden stick.</p>
<p>The one she made was even better than this.</p>
<p>She showed a disgusted look and said, “I’m not playing with it!”</p>
<p>The one Yu Qingshi made and gave to her was very pretty!</p>
<p>Rejected by the little girl, Hong Xingguo’s face twitched a little, but he soon calmed down and took out other things.</p>
<p>“Come, this is the souvenir that Granduncle brought you. It’s really delicious, you know?” What he was holding in his hands was a bunch of wild fruits.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman gave it a glance and showed the same disgusted expression again.</p>
<p>“You can find this everywhere here.”</p>
<p>She had already eaten a lot of them!</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo took a deep breath and stared at her.</p>
<p>“Xiaoman, Granduncle is tired after traveling on the mountain road for a long time, let Granduncle go inside to rest?” Hong Xingguo was still in the yard. It was very wide and open, and passerbys’ could see what was happening inside.</p>
<p>The place was bright and open, not suitable for committing a crime.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman refused. “No. Grandma said that you can’t let strangers enter the house. Go away quickly, or I will call Grandma.”</p>
<p>“Granduncle is not a stranger, we have met before, right?”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman replied, “Yes, I’ve seen you twice. But every time you come, you always come to fight with Grandma.”</p>
<p>“…” Why did this brat have such a good memory?</p>
<p>A long time had passed, how come she still remembered it so clearly?</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo was very angry, but pretended to smile again. He took out a handful of colorful candies and tempted her, “Granduncle hasn’t come to your place often and does not know his way around here. After eating my candy, can you show me the way around? I won’t enter your house, I just want to look for someone.”</p>
<p>This person was very evil.</p>
<p>If she was a regular kid, she would’ve been coaxed long ago and have forgotten anything else!</p>
<p>But it was his misfortune that she wasn’t just any regular kid!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman put her hands on her hips and bluntly said, “I don’t believe you. Do you think I’m still three-years-old?”</p>
<p>She stretched out five fingers, “I am five years old this year!”</p>
<p>“…” Hong Xingguo was furious.</p>
<p>He ran out of patience.</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo laughed coldly and took out a piece of cloth. Then, he covered her nose and mouth without saying anything.</p>
<p>The cloth was drugged.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman’s eyes went wide open, as if she didn’t expect him to still have such a trick. She struggled a few times, but soon there was no more movement.</p>
<p>She had fainted.</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo placed her in a bag without saying a word, and walked away while carrying her on his back.</p>
<p>System: “……”</p>
<p>It had wanted to remind its host not to reason with bad guys, because bad guys do not need a reason to do bad things.</p>
<p>But it didn’t expect Hong Xingguo to be so quick and ruthless, to work so nimbly and cleanly.</p>
<p>He took her away without saying anything else.</p>
<p>Read latest Chapters at <b>Wuxia</b>World.Site Only</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman didn’t even get the chance to make any sound.</p>
<p>Many people in the village knew Hong Xingguo, and of the grudge between him and Jiang Xiumei. They knew that their two families did not communicate often, and they were considered to have broken their relationship.</p>
<p>Seeing him come again during New Year’s Eve, they thought he was looking for freebies again and ridiculed him, “Oh, this… Isn’t this that… Who was it again? Did you come here to cause trouble again? Aren’t you a man, have you no shame? Unfortunately people don’t want you, this poor relative anymore. Why don’t you have some shame.”</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo’s eyes were shifty, and he quickened his pace as he walked with a guilty conscience. He tried explaining, “Who is here to cause trouble? I’m here to bring some gifts, but she wouldn’t even let me come in. So cruel!”</p>
<p>The group of people laughed and watched him leave.</p>

<p>I’ll Die in Front of Your Eyes (2)</p>
<p>Only then could Hong Xingguo wipe off his cold sweat. He stuffed Jiang Xiaoman inside a run-down car that he rented and left.</p>
<p>He wanted to take Jiang Xiaoman to get some money.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when Hong Xingguo went out to do some errands, he saw a missing person notice on the road.</p>
<p>He couldn’t read what was written, and only understood after asking other people. It said that a girl had been lost since she was a baby. The family had been looking for her for several years but had not managed to find her. If anyone could provide clues or find the child, they would reward them.</p>
<p>There was a picture of the baby on the missing person notice.</p>
<p>All babies looked the same, so naturally no one could provide any clue.</p>
<p>But Hong Xingguo was different.</p>
<p>He had seen Jiang Xiaoman when she was a child, and he felt that the baby looked very similar to her. In addition, her origins were unknown, and he had long suspected that the Jiang family had stolen or abducted her. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that it was a big possibility. He planned to bring Xiaoman there for the reward.</p>
<p>Anyways, the missing person notice said that regardless of whether it was the correct child or not, as long as he provided some information, he could get some money.</p>
<p>What if the blind cat ran into a dead mouse?</p>
<p>Didn’t that mean getting rich overnight?</p>
<p>But if he wanted to take Jiang Xiaoman away, Jiang Xiumei would definitely not agree.</p>
<p>The reward was also very impressive, and Hong Xingguo wanted to take it all for himself and didn’t want to split it. If the people who lost the child found out that Jiang Xiumei was the one who raised the child for so many years and gave the money to her instead, then what?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t he have done everything for nothing?</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Hong Xingguo came up with this strategy.</p>
<p>As long as he moved fast enough and finalized the matter before the Jiang family could react, then the money would be his. On top of that, he could report the Jiang family for kidnapping and selling children, so Jiang Xiumei and Jiang Xing would definitely get punished.</p>
<p>If both of them were in prison, then wouldn’t Jiang Xing’s logistics team and the family properties he fought for fall to his hands as their relative?</p>
<p>This would be killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop a smile from forming at the corners of his mouth, and he took Xiaoman away from the village overnight.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>When Jiang Xiaoman woke up, the sky had already turned dark.</p>
<p>She didn’t sleep well; her head was still dizzy and her mind was cloudy.</p>
<p>She looked around and found herself inside a small house. It was very small and dark, and had a musty smell. The corner of the wall was cracked, with water seeping in and moss growing on it.</p>
<p>It was quiet outside without any sound, only the occasional noise from the traffic. It seemed that the location was very remote.</p>
<p>She sat on the bed shaking her head, her eyes still a bit blank.</p>
<p>“Host, this is a disaster. You’ve been kidnapped.” The system said.</p>
<p>A kidnapper? Wasn’t that a kind of really, really bad person who specialized in bullying children?</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was taken aback for a while. Only after the system reminded her did she recall what happened before she fainted.</p>
<p>It was that Hong Xingguo! That man who claimed to be her Granduncle was the one who had kidnapped her!</p>
<p>Wuu wuu wuu!</p>
<p>No, she had to hold on, she couldn’t cry!</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman held back her tears and said, “Brother System, where is this place?”</p>
<p>“…this system doesn’t know either.”</p>
<p>Where Jiang Xiaoman lived was where the system lived. Jiang Xiaoman had not been to this place before, so naturally the system had not either.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman thought for a while and said, “Where is he going to take me?”</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo was someone who didn’t show up in the script. In the original scenario, he had absolutely nothing to do with her and never appeared in the story. The system had zero knowledge of him.</p>
<p>The system thought about it silently, but there was nothing related to Hong Xingguo at all in its memory bank.</p>
<p>It couldn’t make any guess at all.</p>
<p>“Normally, kidnappers would steal children to sell them or have them beg for money. Either way, there’s no good ending for them. In this situation, I suggest the host to shout for help and run away.”</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman was really obedient and yelled for help a few times.</p>

<p>But the one who came was not a savior, but her enemy instead.</p>
<p>Hong Xingguo was eating instant noodles outside. Hearing Jiang Xiaoman’s cry for help, he immediately rushed inside and sneered, “Smelly girl, I advise you to save your effort. There is no one around. Even if you scream until your throat is sore, no one will hear you. If you don’t obey—”</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes full of threat.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoman’s neck shrank back and she asked, “What are you going to do if I don’t obey?”</p>
<p>“I’ll spank you until you are obedient.”</p>
